  abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a fast developing interconnection of smart technologies that have revolutionised the way the industries work by combining sensors and devices by automating their regular operations through Internet of Things (IoT). In various application domains, IoT devices provide seamless connectivity and diversity. Because of their round-the-clock connectivity these systems and their communication channel are subjected to targeted cyber-attacks. As a result, a multi-level security solution is required to protect the industrial system. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be used to counteract these cyber-attacks by analyzing the data packets for any targeted attacks in the IIoT environment. This paper proposes a cyber-attacks detection framework for IIoT by using the Voting-based Ensemble Learning approach. In the proposed framework, an ensemble of the latest and classical Machine Learning (ML) techniques like Histogram Gradient Boosting (HGB), CatBoost, and Random Forest (RF), and a hard voting classifier are employed for efficient detection of cyber-attacks. In our proposed model, CatBoost exceeds the other two with an accuracy of 99.85 %, while HGB and RF have an accuracy of 97.90 % and 98.83 % respectively.},

In such networks, the traditional network management techniques for monitoring and data analytics face some challenges and issues, e.g., accuracy, and effective processing of big data in a real-time fashion. Moreover, the pattern of network traffic, especially in cellular networks, shows very complex behavior because of various factors, such as device mobility and network heterogeneity. Deep learning has been efficiently employed to facilitate analytics and knowledge discovery in big data systems to recognize hidden and complex patterns. Motivated by these successes, researchers in the field of networking apply deep learning models for Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis (NTMA) applications, e.g., traffic classification and prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive review on applications of deep learning in NTMA. We first provide fundamental background relevant to our review. Then, we give an insight into the confluence of deep learning and NTMA, and review deep learning techniques proposed for NTMA applications.

  abstract = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are becoming more commonplace as a means for cars to communicate and share data on things like traffic patterns, road conditions, and travel times and speeds. Therefore, one of the key issues facing academics now is ensuring data communication safety in VANET. There are several privacy-preserving verification techniques for VANETs. However, they do have complex calculations and safety issues. This research presented an operating platform for the 5G-based VANET architecture that combines Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). The proposed system provides SOM and SDN-based network (SOM-SDN) solutions that will improve safety in two dimensions by spotting and stopping threats. First, this research examines the network's efficiency threats while considering Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) threats. The suggested system's safety was then compared with current DDoS attacks. Additionally, the proposed method is strong enough to fend off typical assaults and maintain the communication information's secrecy, thanks to an examination of its security qualities. The efficiency comparisons' outcomes demonstrate the suggested procedure's light and effectiveness. Additionally, the suggested model using SUMO and NS-3 demonstrates how effective and useful the method is for VANETs. The proposed study shows a 92% improvement in performance, a 4% reduction in end-to-end latency, a 92% improvement in transmission outbound, a 98% improvement in packet transmission rate, and a 94% improvement in the enumeration of bounce compared to prior studies.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I present B-DRIVE—a blockchain-based distributed IoT (Internet of Things) network for smart urban transportation. The network is designed to connect a large fleet of IoT devices, installed on various vehicles and roadside infrastructures, to distributed data storage centers, called as Full-Nodes, to log and disseminate sensor generated data. It connects devices from around the city to multiple Full-Nodes to log timestamped data into the blockchain. These sensors vary from GPS (Global Positioning System), air quality meter, gyrometer to speed cameras in order to facilitate efficient urban mobility. The three identified hardware layers that comprise the network are the IoT layer, Storage layer, and User layer. They consist of Moving/Static-Nodes, Full-Nodes, and Smart devices, respectively. The Moving/Static-Nodes are primarily made up of moving vehicles and road-side infrastructures, respectively, thus acting as various data sources. Whereas, Full-Nodes and Smart devices are institutions and mobile phones, acting as data handler/disseminator and navigator/data visualizer, respectively. The data, or data blocks, received by Full-Nodes get appended into Full and Running-Blockchain, meant for specific purposes. The network is designed to be free from any block mining activity. It provides open access to anonymous sensor data to end-users, especially scientists, policy-makers and entrepreneurs, to develop innovative urban transportation solutions. It is believed that a system like B-DRIVE, along with existing VANETs (Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks), is capable of answering some of the current urban transportation issues around traffic congestion, navigation, and vehicle parking. Other applications of blockchain data could vary from user activity mapping to VGI (volunteered geographic information) data quality assessment. Two identified limitations of the presented architecture are the low processing power of current IoT devices and the lack of urban IoT infrastructure.},

  abstract = {With the increase in sophistication and connectedness of the healthcare networks, their attack surfaces and vulnerabilities increase significantly. Malicious agents threaten patients’ health and life by stealing or altering data as it flows among the multiple domains of healthcare networks. The problem is likely to exacerbate with the increasing use of IoT devices, edge, and core clouds in the next generation healthcare networks. Presented in this paper is MUSE, a system of deep hierarchical stacked neural networks for timely and accurate detection of malicious activity that leads to alteration of meta-information or payload of the dataflow between the IoT gateway, edge and core clouds. Smaller models at the edge clouds take substantially less time to train as compared to the large models in the core cloud. To improve the speed of training and accuracy of detection of large core cloud models, the MUSE system uses a novel method of merging and aggregating layers of trained edge cloud models to construct a partly pre-trained core cloud model. As a result, the model in the core cloud takes substantially smaller number of epochs (6 to 8) and, consequently, less time, compared to those in the edge clouds, training of which take 35 to 40 epochs to converge. With the help of extensive evaluations, it is shown that with the MUSE system, large, merged models can be trained in significantly less time than the unmerged models that are created independently in the core cloud. Through several runs it is seen that the merged models give on an average 26.2% reduction in training times. From the experimental evaluation we demonstrate that along with fast training speeds the merged MUSE model gives high training and test accuracies, ranging from 95% to 100%, in detection of unknown attacks on dataflows. The merged model thus generalizes very well on the test data. This is a marked improvement when compared with the accuracy given by un-merged model as well as accuracy reported by other researchers with newer datasets.},

  abstract = {The combination of traditional cloud computing and mobile computing leads to the novel paradigm of mobile cloud computing. Due to the mobility of network nodes in mobile cloud computing, security has been a challenging problem of paramount importance. When a mobile cloud involves heterogeneous client networks, such as Wireless Sensor Networks and Vehicular Networks, the security problem becomes more challenging because the client networks often have different security requirements in terms of computational complexity, power consumption, and security levels. To securely collect and fuse the data from heterogeneous client networks in complex systems of this kind, novel security schemes need to be devised. Intrusion detection is one of the key security functions in mobile clouds involving heterogeneous client networks. A variety of different rule-based intrusion detection methods could be employed in this type of systems. However, the existing intrusion detection schemes lead to high computation complexity or require frequent rule updates, which seriously harms their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based intrusion detection scheme for mobile clouds involving heterogeneous client networks. The proposed scheme does not require rule updates and its complexity can be customized to suit the requirements of the client networks. Technically, the proposed scheme includes two steps: multi-layer traffic screening and decision-based Virtual Machine (VM) selection. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme is highly effective in terms of intrusion detection.},

The ML models work through the traditional training and testing approaches. However, execution of such kind of approaches may not function effectively in case if a system is connected to the Internet.

The game-theoretic solution determines the favorable parameters (strategies), predicts the player’s behavior, and suggests the best settings for minimizing the attack’s effect. To this end, our paper attempts to study the usefulness of game-theoretic applications for the prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on a drone by deriving the information from conventional game solutions and augmenting that with the bounded rationality concept called Quantal response equilibrium (QRE). In this process, we identify feasible strategies for each player through simulations and formulate five non-cooperative game scenarios for two variants of DDoS attacks. In these games, the traditional game-theoretic solution or Nash Equilibrium (NashE) provides information about the drone’s recommended settings, the hacker’s preferred strategy, and the game-theoretic threshold assuming that all participants are highly intelligent. We augment this information by considering the participant’s tendency to make errors and the evolution in their behavioral pattern from zero to high-values of rationality using QRE. The information coupled from NashE and QRE provides better clarity to a drone operator, thus improving the drone’s security by two levels and allowing the drone operator to take timely precautions. Inspired by this multilevel process, we propose an equivalent real-world framework for protecting Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) nodes against a DDoS attack.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged over the past ten years as the newest technology trend that is luring researchers and developers from every sector of industry and academia. However, IoT is experiencing a number of security issues that are impeding its rapid development, especially those related to service availability, which has grown into a significant obstacle to be overcome. Denial of service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are among the threats that can disturb even inactivate the functionalities of the IoT networks, like their ability to collect, process, and transfer data. To date, many methods have been proposed to identify, detect, and mitigate such attacks in the IoT domain, while many surveys have been conducted to review and classify these solutions. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them has conducted a holistic study to review, classify, and correlate both theoretical and practical aspects used in the design and validation of those approaches. To address this need, we have examined recent and noteworthy research on DoS and DDoS attacks, resulting in the selection of 80 papers to be considered in our study. As a starting point, after identifying in-depth the theoretical aspects commonly used in the detection of such attacks, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies them. In the second step, we inventoried and produced a complete classification of all the practical aspects used in the validation and evaluation of detection and mitigation approaches, including methods, testbeds, hardware, software, datasets, libraries, and metrics. In the third step, we conducted a technical analysis of the surveyed literature by considering different aspects. As a final step, we perform a statistical analysis in order to discuss various research questions that strive to provide a better insight of the prevalent tendencies in this domain by exploring, for each attack, the most appropriate approach and validation process to consider in dealing with it. The main findings of this analysis show that the research is leaning towards using machine learning, mainly by considering supervised algorithms to detect different variants of flooding attacks. Moreover, simulation appears to be the most operated method to validate the surveyed literature while analytical and empiric validations have been seldom adopted mainly to evaluate classical approaches to detect perception layer attacks.},

This paper proposes an effective detection technique against DDoS attack in SDN control plane and data plane. For the control plane, the technique detects DDoS attacks through a Deep Learning (DL) model using new features extracted from traffic statistics. A DL method (AE-BGRU) for DDoS detection uses Autoencoder (AE) with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU). The proposed features for the control plane include unknown IP destination address, packets inter-arrival time, Transport layer protocol (TLP) header, and Type of service (ToS) header. For the data plane, the technique tracks the switch's average arrival bit rate with an unknown destination address in the data plane. Then, the technique detects DDoS attacks through a DL-based model which also uses AE with BGRU. The proposed features in the data plane include the switch's stored capacity, the average rate of packets with unknown destination addresses, the IP Options header, and the average number of flows. The dataset is generated from feature extraction and computations from normal and attack packets and used with the classifier. Also, additional Machine Learning (ML) methods are used to enhance the detection process. If the model detects an attack, the technique mitigates DDoS effects by updating the user's trust value and blocking suspicious senders based on the trust value. The experimental results proved that compared to related techniques, the suggested method had a higher accuracy and lower false alarm rate.},

  abstract = {In the very near future, transportation will go through a transitional period that will shape the industry beyond recognition. Smart vehicles have played a significant role in the advancement of intelligent and connected transportation systems. Continuous vehicular cloud service availability in smart cities is becoming a crucial subscriber necessity which requires improvement in the vehicular service management architecture. Moreover, as smart cities continue to deploy diversified technologies to achieve assorted and high-performance cloud services, security issues with regards to communicating entities which share personal requester information still prevails. To mitigate these concerns, we introduce an automated secure continuous cloud service availability framework for smart connected vehicles that enables an intrusion detection mechanism against security attacks and provides services that meet users’ quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) requirements. Continuous service availability is achieved by clustering smart vehicles into service-specific clusters. Cluster heads are selected for communication purposes with trusted third-party entities (TTPs) acting as mediators between service requesters and providers. The most optimal services are then delivered from the selected service providers to the requesters. Furthermore, intrusion detection is accomplished through a three-phase data traffic analysis, reduction, and classification technique used to identify positive trusted service requests against false requests that may occur during intrusion attacks. The solution adopts deep belief and decision tree machine learning mechanisms used for data reduction and classification purposes, respectively. The framework is validated through simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in terms of intrusion attack detection. The proposed solution achieved an overall accuracy of 99.43% with 99.92% detection rate and 0.96% false positive and false negative rate of 1.53%.},

  abstract = {The number of vehicles travelling on the road has increased tremendously over the past few decades throughout the globe. The advent of Intelligent Transport System (ITS) enabled the vehicles to be managed intelligently. However, the ITS network can be intruded by malicious users to access the sensitive information. So a strong Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to safeguard the ITS network. Due to the huge volume of data generated by the sensors in the vehicles in ITS, there is a dire need to extract the most important features from the ITS data for classification phase in IDS. Even though, many researchers have worked on building an IDS system in ITS, not much work is done on addressing the aforementioned issue. To address this problem, we have utilized the Moth–Flame Optimization (MFO) in this work. In the proposed work, a MFO based ensemble machine learning model is proposed to classify the IDS dataset in ITS. Firstly the IDS dataset is normalized using the standard-scaler method. Then optimal features from the IDS dataset are chosen by MFO. These optimal features are trained by an ensemble classifier comprising of linear regression, random forest and XGBoost classification algorithms for intelligent decision making. The performance of the proposed model is compared against several state of the art meta-heuristic algorithms based on ensemble models which achieved a superior accuracy and recall of 100%, and precision of 99.5% on shellcode attacks.},

The characteristics of heterogeneity, constrained resources, scaling requirements, an uncontrolled environment, and so on make security and privacy concerns far more difficult to tackle than they are today. The high availability required by IoT networks may risk the integrity and security of data carried over the network. Because the majority of security threats occur during data routing activities, developing a safe routing protocol for IoT networks has emerged as the most important research subject. The efficient procedures required to allow secure data transfer for autos enabled by IoT technology are detailed here. Using a novel cryptography-based routing mechanism, this study demonstrates how to protect V2V and V2I communications in the context of the VANET against a wide range of cyber threats. It is a data encryption and decryption technology based on attributes and identity that has been designed to have the lowest computational overhead while retaining the best level of security. To provide efficient message authentication and integrity while ensuring vehicle privacy and safeguarding vehicular communications, a hybrid cryptography system integrating ABS and IBS, named AIBS (Attribute-Identity Based Signature), was created. The recommended cryptography-based solution is tested in the presence of prospective attackers on the network while using the NS2 tool. The simulation results have been measured in terms of average throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), communication delay, and communication overhead.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, connected vehicles have a major role in enhancing the driving experience. Connected vehicles in the network share their knowledge with the help of the network known as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, connection through the network comes with risks ranging from privacy concerns to security vulnerabilities in the network. Inside vehicles, many sensors and Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are connected via specific network protocols, known as Intra-Vehicle communications, to assist the driver in tasks such as autonomous driving. Communicating through different protocols results in security openness for attackers to disturb the normal functioning of sensors and ECUs, which sometimes has detrimental effects. Moreover, in IoV, there is active communication between vehicles and other vehicles or road infrastructures alongside the network, known as Inter-Vehicle communications. Inter-Vehicle communications can also be an open vulnerability to intruders. Motivated by the mentioned security problems, many research initiatives have elaborated on building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect malicious behavior threatening the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of IoV. In this survey, we first provide a structured classification of IoV environment, its components, and the vulnerabilities of inter/intra-vehicle networks. Then, we provide a comprehensive literature review regarding numerous proposed IDS for IoV networks. Further, we discuss IDS criteria with a focus on essential areas that should be taken into account while assessing IoV network security, which can be related to IDS implementation constraints or further privacy requirements.},

Large-scale networks, dynamic topology structure, uneven nodes distribution, and unlimited mobility are the characteristics of IITS. It increased the risk of a variety of attacks related to authentication, credentials, availability, privacy, routing, and legitimacy of data. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attack plays a vital role in impairing Road Side Units (RSU) of IITS and is capable of evading classical data filtering methods. In this paper, a novel DDoS flooding attack detection method is proposed for ensuring the security of IITS by employing reinforcement learning. The proposed framework is implemented by addressing the security requirements of ITS and overcoming the flaws of existing detection methods in advanced vehicular systems. In addition, the Q learning algorithm is designed along with the framework. Other attacks, in addition to DDoS flooding attacks, should be mitigated in the future to ensure a completely secure connection.},

On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) based techniques are playing a major role in effective utilization of the computing resources and offering Quality of Service (QoS). Based on the customer’s application requirements, several cloud computing-based paradigms i.e., edge computing, fog computing, mist computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), cybertwin, and industry 4.0 have been evolved. These paradigms collaborate to offer customer-centric services with the backend of cloud server/data center. In brief, cloud computing has been emerged with respect to the above-mentioned paradigms to enhance the Quality of Experience (QoE) for the users. In particular, ML techniques are the motivating factor to backend the cloud for emerging paradigms, and ML techniques are essentially enhancing the usages of these paradigms by solving several problems of scheduling, resource provisioning, resource allocation, load balancing, Virtual Machine (VM) migration, offloading, VM mapping, energy optimization, workload prediction, device monitoring, etc. However, a comprehensive survey focusing on multi-paradigm integrated architectures, technical and analytical aspects of these paradigms, and the role of ML techniques in emerging cloud computing paradigms are still missing, and this domain needs to be explored. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first survey that investigates the emerging cloud computing paradigms integration considering the most dominating problem-solving technology i.e., ML. This survey article provides a comprehensive summary and structured layout for the vast research on ML techniques in the emerging cloud computing paradigm. This research presents a detailed literature review of emerging cloud computing paradigms: cloud, edge, fog, mist, IoT, SDN, cybertwin, and industry 4.0 (IIoT) along with their integration using ML. To carry out this study, majorly, the last five years (2017-21) articles are explored and analyzed thoroughly to understand the emerging integrated architectures, the comparative study on several attributes, and recent trends.

To better defend against DDoS attacks, we focus on tracing the source and propose a statistics-based traceback scheme using the advantages of the SDN architecture. We analyze the changes of flow through the Base Station (BS) nodes to calculate the eigenvalue and establish the anomaly tree. Then prune it with DDoS detection algorithm to get the attack path. Through the experiments, we obtain the optimal parameters to make the proposed scheme more flexible and effective. It shows that the scheme consumes fewer network resources and saves time than traditional ones while keeping the DDoS defense accuracy at a high level.},

With this, to meet the demand for real-time response, a processing layer is introduced near the user end which is known as the fog computing layer. The fog layer lies in the user’s vicinity and thus highly attracts malicious and/or curious intruders. As a result, the trust of the network gets negatively impacted. Motivated by the aforementioned issue, the authors consider Reputation-based trust and propose a RepuTE Framework in the Fog-IoT domain. The given framework consists of a soft voting ensemble learning model that classifies and predicts two popular reputation-based attacks namely, DoS/ DDoS and Sybil attacks. Furthermore, a novel feature selection technique is also presented that selects the most relevant features well in advance. The performance evaluation is done on NSL-KDD, CICDDOS2019, IoTID20, NBaIoT2018, TON_IoT, and UNSW_NB15 benchmarked IoT and network traffic datasets. The comprehensive performance analysis depicts that the proposed model attains 99.99% accuracy and outperforms other recent state-of-the-art works.

Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) represent the critical enablers of 5G technology with the development of next-generation intelligent vehicular networks and applications. In recent years, researchers have focused on the integration of SDN and VANET, and looked at different topics related to the architecture, the benefits of software-defined VANET services, and the new functionalities to adapt them. However, the security and robustness of the complete architecture is still questionable and have been largely neglected by the research community. Moreover, the deployment and integration of different entities and several architectural components drive new security threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, first, we survey the state-of-the-art SDN based Vehicular ad-hoc Network (SDVN) architectures for their networking infrastructure design, functionalities, benefits, and challenges. Then we discuss these architectures against major security threats that violate the key security services such as availability, privacy, authentication, and data integrity. We also discuss different countermeasures for these threats. Finally, we present the lessons learned with the directions of future research work towards provisioning stringent security solutions in new SDVN architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that presents a comprehensive survey and security analysis on SDVN architectures, and we believe that it will help researchers to address various challenges (e.g., flexible network management, control and high resource utilization, and scalability) in vehicular communication systems which are required to improve the future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).},

NDN is one of the implementations of Information-Centric Networking (ICN).

However, despite promising features offered by NDN, it is still susceptible to various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, mainly Interest Flooding Attacks (IFA). Various mitigation solutions exist in the literature; however, legitimate users and their traffic are usually affected by these solutions. In this paper, we propose a lightweight mechanism called MSIDN, to mitigate sophisticated interest flooding-based DoS and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks in NDN. MSIDN aims to mitigate attacks at the source of communication without affecting the legitimate users. MSIDN relies on data producers’ feedback which is used by the routers to employ precise rate-limiting and block the attackers. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the proposed MSIDN in terms of its robustness during various attack scenarios, dealing with malicious traffic without affecting the legitimate requests, and mitigating attacks at the source side of the communication.},

Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, in this paper, we explored Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)-based models and techniques which are capable off to identify and mitigate both the known as well as unknown attacks. ML and DL-based techniques have the capabilities to learn from the traffic pattern using training and testing datasets in the extensive network domains to make intelligent decisions concerning attack identification and mitigation. We also proposed a DL and ML-based Secure Data Analytics (SDA) architecture to classify normal or attack input data. A detailed taxonomy of SDA is abstracted into a threat model. This threat model addresses various research challenges in SDA using multiple parameters such as-efficiency, latency, accuracy, reliability, and attacks launched by the attackers. Finally, a comparison of existing SDA proposals with respect to various parameters is presented, which allows the end users to select one of the SDA proposals in comparison to its merits over the others.},

  abstract = {The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is an evolutionary extension of the traditional Internet of Things (IoT) into processes and machines for applications in the industrial sector. The IIoT systems generate a large amount of private and sensitive data i.e., stored and processed somewhere on the cloud-edge continuum. The IIoT devices, and the IIoT networks are subject to security mechanisms such as intelligent Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) systems, that can detect and respond unseen malicious network attacks. The adoption of centralized machine learning methods for IDS has become impractical due to the high computational cost and privacy concerns associated with storing large amounts of data on a single server along the cloud-edge continuum. The combination of federated learning and Blockchain has emerged as a promising advancement in addressing the challenge. Federated learning distributes learning to individual IIoT devices without compromising data privacy, while Blockchain enhances privacy and security. Many academic and industrial efforts outline IDS mechanisms using machine learning, deep learning, federated learning, and Blockchain technologies. The utilization of federated learning-based IDS has become increasingly popular and is now being applied to various tasks including IDS/IPS systems. However, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) survey are limited to the scope of classical machine learning and deep learning. To address this limitation, we analyze the IIoT literature that integrates Blockchain and federated learning to enhance IDSs and improve its threat detection capabilities. This survey explores the role of Blockchain and federated learning in addressing security and privacy issues, particularly those associated with IDS/IPS in IIoT networks. Insights on the possibilities of machine learning, federated learning, and Blockchain in supporting IDS to monitor IIoT network traffic for anomaly detection are discussed in detail through state of the art. Furthermore, we provide a set of recommendation based on our literature for the effective implementation of a Blockchain and federated learning-based network intrusion detection system. Finally, we summarize the study and highlight challenges as future research directions for Blockchain and Federated Learning-based technologies for cybersecurity and intrusion detection in IIoT.},

However, the use of Named Data Networking on top of vehicular networks brings various challenges, especially in security and trust levels. The use of the distributed and control-less in-network caching allows malicious users to use the built-in design to launch attacks at the cache-store. Moreover, a malicious node can serve invalid or unlimited Interests to start an Interest flooding attack. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based Blockchain mechanism to secure both of Interest and Data forwarding plane, and content caching.

However, the traditional VANETs face various technical challenges in meeting the basic requirements of intelligent transportation systems such as scalability, flexibility and management due to the ever-increasing number of intelligent vehicles. With its flexible, programmable, scalable network structure, Software Defined Networks (SDNs) are candidates for providing solutions to the problems experienced. The architecture, which was created by adapting the SDN paradigm to the traditional VANET is simply called SD-VANET. This new architecture allows easy scaling of the network and flexible network management. Despite the advantages of SD-VANET architecture, it is also vulnerable to cyberattack threats such as Distributed Denial Of Service (DDoS). In this study, different machine learning classifiers were used to detect DDoS attacks targeting SD-VANETs. First, a dataset containing features of normal network traffic and DDoS attack network traffic was obtained from an experimentally created SD-VANET topology. Then the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) feature selection algorithm was used to select the most distinctive features of the dataset. Machine learning classifiers were trained and tested with both original and feature selection applied datasets. Moreover, in the learning phase, hyperparameter optimization for the classifiers was applied using the Bayesian optimization method. According to the experimental results, the highest accuracy score obtained was 99.35% with MRMR feature selection and Bayesian optimization-based decision tree classifier. The results demonstrate that the MRMR feature selection and Bayesian optimization-based classifier approach have been successful for the detection of DDoS attacks on SD-VANETs.},

There is a very real risk that today's vehicles are subjected to cyber-attacks that target vehicular communications. This paper proposes a three-layer framework (sensing, communication and control) through which automotive security threats can be better understood. The sensing layer is made up of vehicle dynamics and environmental sensors, which are vulnerable to eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. The communication layer is comprised of both in-vehicle and V2X communications and is susceptible to eavesdropping, spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and sybil attacks. At the top of the hierarchy is the control layer, which enables autonomous vehicular functionality, including the automation of a vehicle's speed, braking, and steering. Attacks targeting the sensing and communication layers can propagate upward and affect the functionality and can compromise the security of the control layer. This paper provides the state-of-the-art review on attacks and threats relevant to the communication layer and presents countermeasures.},

  abstract = {Today's technologically advanced connected world is mostly reliant on the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart gadgets and easy connectivity. These smart gadgets are more susceptible to malicious practices found in network traffic, which is one of the biggest challenges in cyber security domain. As a result, many systems and end-users are adversely affected by this practice. However, intrusion detection systems (IDS) are often applied to guard against cyber-attacks. Since, IDS plays a key role in detecting and preventing cyber-attacks in IoT-enabled networks, but design of an efficient and fast IDS system for cyber-attack detection is still a challenging research issue. Moreover, IDS datasets contain multiple features and to design an efficient and fast IDS, feature selection (FS) is an essential mechanism to remove the irrelevant and redundant features from large IDS datasets. Thus, this paper has proposed a hybrid feature selection scheme in which statistical test-based filter approaches such as Chi-Square (χ^2), Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC), and Mutual Information (MI) are combined with a Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II)-based metaheuristic approach for optimization of features. In the proposed scheme, filter-based methods are employed to rank the features for guided population initialization in NSGA-II for faster convergence towards a solution. Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is evaluated using the ToN-IoT dataset in terms of number of selected features and accuracy. Experimental outcomes are compared with some latest state-of-art techniques. Result analysis confirms the superior performance of the proposed scheme with minimum number of optimized features (only 13 out of 43 features) and maximum accuracy (99.48%).},

The number of internet users increase everyday which in turn increases the network traffic and data volume. The energy-limited sensor node resources in the IoT environment are vulnerable to attacks due to the networking procedures, open broadcast communication, etc. Intruders easily gain access to the network and perform different types of attacks which degrades the overall performance and quality of services. Intrusion detection systems are developed to detect different kinds of attacks that cannot be detected by the firewalls. Based on the features, the intrusion detection system classifies the normal and abnormal characteristics of the system. Various intrusion detection systems based on machine learning models have evolved so far. However, the feature selection process is much important to enhance the classification performance. Thus, in this research work, a deep learning-based feature selection procedure is presented to select the optimal features. The decision tree algorithm is utilized as a classifier to classify the deep features and detect attacks in the IoT network. Benchmark NSL-KDD dataset has been used for experimentation and the parameters like precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy are evaluated for the proposed model and the conventional models to validate the superior performance.

VFC consumes less bandwidth, decreased response time, and congestion of core cloud due to sort distance. VFC performs resource allocation to select the appropriate vehicle for computation according to the available computational resource. It performs data retrieval operations to transfer traffic data from vehicle to vehicular fog because direct communication is limited by the transmission range of the vehicle. VFC faces various issues during resource allocation and data retrieval operation such as vehicle's high mobility, dynamic topology and etc. This causes uneven resource distribution due to inefficient resource allocation and late data delivery due to unfeasible data retrieval. The security and privacy leakage of traffic data threaten due to sharing in vehicular fog. To overcome these issues, we provide in-depth exploration at each phase of the VFC operation. Hence, we present a new classification of VFC operation, which classifies the challenges every phase such as resource allocation in task division, scheduling, and load balancing; result-retrieval in phase, node selector, node selection and path recovery; secure data sharing in authentication, encipherment, auditing, and data privacy.

Security agencies are in continuous search for technologies and intelligent systems that are capable of detecting drones. Unfortunately, breakthroughs in relevant technologies are hindered by the lack of open source databases for drone’s Radio Frequency (RF) signals, which are remotely sensed and stored to enable developing the most effective way for detecting and identifying these drones. This paper presents a stepping stone initiative towards the goal of building a database for the RF signals of various drones under different flight modes. We systematically collect, analyze, and record raw RF signals of different drones under different flight modes such as: off, on and connected, hovering, flying, and video recording. In addition, we design intelligent algorithms to detect and identify intruding drones using the developed RF database. Three deep neural networks (DNN) are used to detect the presence of a drone, the presence of a drone and its type, and lastly, the presence of a drone, its type, and flight mode. Performance of each DNN is validated through a 10-fold cross-validation process and evaluated using various metrics. Classification results show a general decline in performance when increasing the number of classes. Averaged accuracy has decreased from 99.7% for the first DNN (2-classes), to 84.5% for the second DNN (4-classes), and lastly, to 46.8% for the third DNN (10-classes). Nevertheless, results of the designed methods confirm the feasibility of the developed drone RF database to be used for detection and identification. The developed drone RF database along with our implementations are made publicly available for students and researchers alike.},

First, this paper introduces an environmental agent for training data resampling to solve the imbalance problem of the original data. Second, rewards are redefined in reinforcement learning. In order to improve the recognition rate of few categories of network attacks, we set different reward values for different categories of attacks.

AE-SAC achieves excellent classification performance with an accuracy of 84.15% and a f1-score of 83.97% on the NSL-KDD dataset, and an accuracy and a f1-score over 98.9% on the AWID dataset.},

At the same time, this allures the adversaries to exploit the OSNs as a soft target for easy execution of various attacks that can quickly spread to a large number of users. In distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, an adversary aims to overwhelm the normal traffic of a targeted server with a flood of fake login messages so that the associated Internet service or website turns inoperable. In this paper, we propose a secure and lightweight authentication scheme (PRDoS) that resists DDoS and other security attacks in mobile OSN environments. We provide a multi-faceted solution towards the remedy of DDoS attacks in the OSN environment. After a certain threshold, the scheme discards further user login attempts and blocks an adversary who intends to overload the network server. We use the pre-loaded shadow identity and emergency key pairs, and a key-refilling strategy that rebuilds the essential synchronization between a blocked naive user and the OSN server. This technique restores the intended un-linkability property of the protocol. Using NS3 simulation, we study the impact of DDoS attackers on network throughput and network delay. Moreover, we validate and compare the proposed scheme against state-of-the-art solutions using the real attacks and benign datasets. We use the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) DoS dataset 2017, which is generated by capturing the normal and DoS attack packets separately with subsequent pre-processed for testing. We also use the machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution in a practical attack detection scenario. We observe that these algorithms provide 97.05%, 95.48%, and 96.6% DDoS attack detection accuracy, respectively.},

  abstract = {Vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs) are gaining popularity because they can potentially increase traffic efficiency with road safety in cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS). Effective vehicle deployment requires the identification of nodes providing false data. Researchers have focused much of their attention on an important issue called misbehaviour detection for disseminating false data about vehicle information (position, time, speed and vehicle id) in VANETs. It can threaten the security and privacy of the network and cause some problems, including accidents, collisions, and traffic congestion. There are more works have been proposed based on machine learning methods. However, all of the machine learning-based detection models used currently are signature-based, necessitating previous knowledge of the attacks to identify them and also requiring numerous features, which increases the computational time needed to detect attacks and to select the high-performing features; this works a marine predator algorithm based on teaching-learning. The article provides a unique deep learning strategy to recognize the position falsification attacks in VANETs to find hidden patterns from the data for fighting against known and emerging threats. We evaluate our method using a publicly accessible VeReMi dataset, demonstrating that it achieves high detection accuracy of 99.55% for various attacks. According to our findings, our method can be useful for enhancing VANET security and assuring vehicular communications' reliable and secure functioning.},

Data dissemination in VANET is a challenging task due to high dynamics in topology, mobility, and links connection. Internet model (i.e., TCP/IP) is inefficient for VANET data dissemination due to the host/address-centric, and connection-oriented communication mechanism that is fundamentally designed for stable wired networks. Recently, Named Data Networking (NDN) paradigm has been used as a promising perfect-enabler underlying vehicular communication model, i.e., Vehicular Named Data Networking (V-NDN) model. In NDN, the nodes communication involves named-based data-centric operations decoupled from the data provider address/location. Several V-NDN data dissemination schemes have been proposed. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey representing a thorough-critical presentation of recently proposed V-NDN data dissemination solutions and introduce a new fine-grained taxonomy for these solutions. Then, a qualitative comparison of the reviewed solutions based on several parameters is provided. We also suggest a unified performance evaluation metrics in this domain. Finally, we present the open problems in V-NDN data dissemination and highlight the directions of future-oriented solutions. This comprehensive and self-contained survey can contribute to the exploration and understanding of this research domain. Consequently, the future solutions in the aspects of unresolved problems and inefficient resolutions may be directed towards new solving methods.},

Considering their vital role in network security, intrusion detection systems (IDS) have received significant interest in the research community. IDS can be divided into anomaly intrusion detection systems (AIDS) and signature intrusion detection systems (SIDS). In this work, we integrate AIDS to secure IoT environments better and enhance the privacy of data circulated within sensors and actuators which interact with the real world. However, a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) mitigates security issues. We present in this paper an effective NIDS for IoT security relying on machine learning such as K-NN and feature selection. Specifically, we designed our model using K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm to boost the performance and enhance the IDS accuracy (ACC), with feature selection algorithms separately, such as principal component analysis (PCA), genetic algorithm (GA) and univariate statistical test. We elected every feature that two or three methods have selected. Hence, our election-based feature selection method lasted with five features where the model has shown promising results in ACC, false alarm rate (FAR), and detection rate (DR). To evaluate the performance of our model on imbalanced datasets, we ran our tests on the Bot-IoT dataset. We measured the model using Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to have a better performance evaluation, where it scored up to 97%. The suggested model resulted in 99.99% ACC and considerably changed the training time from 21696 seconds for the entire dataset to 102 seconds for the five selected features. Our proposed model provides significant performances compared with previous models},

  abstract = {Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is one of the most important approaches for intelligent vehicles to communicate under complex road conditions. However, as a VANET is working under wireless and complex conditions, it is under the threat of various malicious attacks. One efficient solution to counter those attacks is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which can detect intrusions to the VANET based on the statistical machine learning method. However, most IDS solutions have a problem that they can only detect the attacks which have already known when the IDS is designed/trained. For unknown attacks, most IDSs become inefficient. A blockchain-based Lifetime Learning IDS (LL-IDS) framework has been designed to address this problem. It applies a blockchain to store uncertain data that an IDS cannot decide and is highly likely to be a new type of attacks. With the help of traditional security agencies such as universities, these uncertain data can be labelled to train the IDS model. The incremental learning models are shown to have a great potential in this scenario. In this paper, we introduces a novel IDS named as incremental IDS based on LL-IDS. Numerical experiments show that the computational time consumption and web payload could be decreased by applying the ILL-IDS to a public VANET dataset.},

While large businesses can afford defensive measures against DDoS assaults, the situation is different for new entrepreneurs.

The opportunistic connectivity of the nodes and their ability to join/leave at anytime makes OMNs/DTNs exposed to different kinds of security attacks. Moreover, OMNs/DTNs have been employed in a wide range of applications such as disaster response scenarios, battlefield/military communications, monitoring marine life, and social networks applications. Hence, researchers have identified and studied different security attacks in OMNs/DTNs and proposed several countermeasures/approaches to address (detect, mitigate, and/or prevent) these attacks. To further help future researchers, in this paper, a systematic literature review is conducted to survey the research articles that studied the impacts of four major security attacks (Blackhole, Wormhole, Sybil, and Denial-of-Service) in OMNs/DTNs and the proposed detection/defense mechanisms to address them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review that is based on a predefined search methodology and systematically collects the relevant research articles that were published between 2011 and 2023. After applying the systematic search methodology, 45 research articles were extracted and surveyed that resulted with a redefined taxonomy of the security attacks. Moreover, the authors summarized the proposed detection/defense mechanisms and provided a comparison among them based on their basis, objective(s), attacker models, and performance methodologies/metrics. This survey also provides a discussion of the research gaps and proposes several research topics, challenges, and recommendations to be investigated and addressed by future work.},

In this paper, a DDoS attack detection and defense mechanism based on cognitive-inspired computing with dual address entropy is proposed. The flow table characteristics of the switch are extracted, and a DDoS attack model is built by incorporating the support vector machine classification algorithm. This mechanism can realize real-time detection and defense at the preliminary stage of the DDoS attack and can restore normal communication in time. The experiment shows that our mechanism not only detects attacks quickly but also has a high detection rate and low false positive rate. More importantly, it can take appropriate defense and recovery measures in the time after the attack has been identified.},

Hence, this study investigates Smart Parking system, which integrates many Internet of Things (IoT) components alongside leveraging the use of cloud and edge computing could be the solution. Edge computing is a crucial technology that supports sensor level processing, which is a significant element for data privacy and security in Smart Parking applications. Smart Parking would be able to guide the driver directly to the parking spot, which will minimize or even eliminate the issues in the existing mechanism. It is noteworthy that it is necessary to ensure that the Smart Parking system is secure, because IoT devices are very much prone to security attacks. Further, introducing energy-efficient techniques in Smart Parking will contribute to a greener environment and an economically efficient model. Many studies have focused on Smart Parking with IoT, however, from our critical analysis, we have concluded that many studies have failed to address the security and energy efficiency aspect of smart parking. Hence, we have investigated the impact of security and energy efficiency in Smart Parking system, and have classified the existing literature based on the categories of devises such as sensors, communication protocols, security threats, energy efficiency, applications, and reviews of available resources based on the proposed taxonomy, the study has also tabulated few use cases and emphasized the relationship between IoT, security, and energy efficiency in smart parking, and identified and examined most significant research challenges.},

However, its widespread adoption has also introduced various security vulnerabilities, similar to any nascent technology. One notable threat is the denial of service (DoS) attack, including its distributed form, the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which is the primary focus of this research. This paper aims to explore the impact of different types of DoS and DDoS attacks on edge computing layers by examining the vulnerabilities associated with various edge peripherals. Additionally, existing detection and prevention mechanisms are investigated to address these weaknesses.

However, the mobility demands of our modern society require more advanced IDSs to make a good trade-off between coping with the rapid growth of traffic data and responding to attacks. Thus, in this paper, we propose a lightweight distributed IDS that exploits the advantages of centralized platforms to train and learn from large amounts of data. We investigate the benefits of two promising bio-inspired optimization algorithms, namely Ant Lion Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization, to find the optimal data representation for the classification process. We use Deep Forest as a classifier to detect intrusive actions more robustly and generate as few false positives as possible. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can enhance the reliability of lightweight intrusion detection systems in terms of accuracy and execution time.},

In addition, in a recent issue of the safety and comfort of vehicles and communication technologies for service is required. We propose a traffic flooding attack detection and an in-depth analysis system that uses data mining techniques. In this paper we (1) designed and implemented a system that detects traffic flooding attacks. Then, it executes classification by attack type and it uses SNMP MIB information based on C4.5 algorithm; (2) conducted a semantic interpretation that extracts and analyzes the rules of execution mechanism that are additionally provided by C4.5; (3) performed an in-depth analysis on the attack patterns and useful knowledge inherent in their data by type, utilizing association rule mining. Classification by attack and attack type based on C4.5 and association rules, automatic rule extraction and semantic in-depth interpretation, which are proposed in this paper, provide a positive possibility to add momentum towards the development of new methodologies for intrusion detection systems as well as to support establishing policies for intrusion detection and response systems.},

  abstract = {Autonomous transportation systems have an immense impact on the way of our day-to-day commute or traveling. Connectedness is an inseparable part of these systems, and it is possible through Intelligent Transportation Systems applications. These applications use a network system known as Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). However, the safety that is provided by VANETs can be easily compromised by malicious users. Hence there is a need for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). We designed an IDS model that can collect network data cooperatively from vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs). For training the core of our proposed IDS we generated synthetic network data with the help of the widely used Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) and Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulation tools. We also generated separate test data that is not just a split part of the training data. This ensures the elimination of the misleading performance result of an overfitted model. We employed a multi-class IDS using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a novel feature extraction method known as Context-Aware Feature Extraction-Based CNN (CAFECNN). The CAFECNN model takes advantage of the collected network flow data to detect both passive and active types of attacks. The results show that the proposed model is stronger in identification of hard-to-detect passive attacks compared to traditional machine learning methods. We also evaluated the model using real-time simulations and observed an immediate improvement in the performance of the network despite the intruders, especially in terms of packet delivery ratio and network throughput.},

Applications in VANETs are life critical since human lives are at stake and therefore, interaction among nodes (vehicles) must be established in the most secure manner. To provide security for VANETs, various security measures are designed, the most popular of which is Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). IDS has already proved its worth in detection of malicious nodes in traditional networks but applying the IDS in VANET like networks is somehow different and difficult due to its peculiar characteristics such as resource-constrained nodes, high mobility of nodes, specific protocols stacks, and standards. This paper presents a brief introduction about the various IDSs, in general, to get the readers well acquainted with the concept of IDS after which an in-depth survey of various IDSs that are propounded for VANETs is put forward followed by analyzing and comparing each technique along with merits and demerits. Some basic instructions have also been presented for developing IDSs that have a potential application in VANET and VANET Cloud. Our aim is to identify leading trends, open challenges, and future research directions in the deployment of IDS in VANET. In order to bridge the research gaps in terms of performance, detection rate and overhead, and also to overcome the challenges of existing IDS in literature, a proactive bait based Honeypot optimized IDS system is also proposed with the aim to detect existing and zero-day attacks with minimal overhead.

Federated learning addresses the privacy and security issues of the IoT data in a decentralized manner. Also, it can be capable of training the multiple learning algorithms through local content except for exchanging data through intelligent Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. Moreover, in ICN, the content is retrieved and stored based on the content name rather than the content location address. On the other hand, it is challenging to support the massive IoT devices by the fifth generation (5G) mobile-cellular networks. Therefore, the cellular 6G networks are expected to increase the connection capabilities by 10–100 times over 5G, which necessitates a convergence of Communication, Computing, and Caching (3C). At the same time, the in-network caching capabilities of ICN can be attractive features for IoT networks. IoT aspires to link anybody and/or everything at any time and location. However, integrating IoT with different areas is a new academic topic and is still in its infancy. As a result, this research highlights the potential of ICN for IoTs by conducting an exhaustive literature review. This work provides a comprehensive survey regarding these three recent research trends (i.e., FL, IoT, and ICN) and reviews the related state-of-the-art literature. We first describe the main features of each technology and discuss their most common and used variants. Furthermore, we envision the integration of such technologies to take advantage efficiently. Indeed, we consider their group-wise (FL-ICN-IoT) utilization based on the need for more robust security and privacy. Additionally, we cover the application fields of these technologies both individually and combinedly. Finally, we discuss the open issues of the reviewed research and describe potential directions for future avenues regarding integrating IoT, ICN, and FL technologies.},

Network managers can easily manage and regulate the entire network using its programmable central controller architecture. This central controller serves as the focal point for numerous attack vectors due to its centralized structure. However, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against the SDN is the most prominent. The goal of this project is to use a machine learning method to categorize SDN traffic as either attack or normal traffic. Next, the Feature Selection method, such as the Filter-based Fisher score method, Wrapper-based method, and analysis of variables (ANOVA) f-test, is used for finely-granulated detection. Then, a rule-based detection method using the Renyi joint entropy algorithm is employed to detect DDoS attacks on SDN controllers. We manage a public "DDoS attack SDN Dataset" with 23 attributes overall. The dataset includes normal and attack traffic for the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Except for attributes that specify the target and source machines, the dataset, which contains more than 100,000 recordings, has statistical features such as byte count, duration sec, packet rate, and packet per flow. In the classification process, many classifiers such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) were used. The test results demonstrated the efficacy and efficiency of the suggested strategy using the analysis of variables (ANOVA), which performed better than competing methods across a range of evaluation parameters.},

IoT is prone to several cyberattacks and needs challenging approaches to achieve the desired security. Moreover, with the emergence of IIoT, the security vulnerabilities posed by it are even more devastating. Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized IoT/IIoT architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in IIoT. A case study on two of the most important industrial IoT applications is also highlighted.

  abstract = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) offers expedient services in intellectual transportation models but is susceptible to several attacks. The Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) help to prevent security risks by discovering irregular network behaviours under local sub-networks inspite of complete VANET. An optimization-driven model is devised for detecting intrusion in SDN-VANET. The network comprises several entities, like the On-Board Unit (OBU), SDN, Road-Side Unit (RSU), and Authentication Server. The proposed approach involves five phases, namely registration, key generation, data encoding, authentication, and decoding. The authentication of OBU is done with the data packets. The detection of intrusion is performed using the optimized model. The selection of features is done from log files considering the Renyi entropy. The detection of intrusion is done using the Rider-based neural network (RideNN), trained with designed Rider-based Sea Lion Optimization (RBSLO), and is produced by blending the Rider optimization algorithm (ROA) and Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). The proposed RBSLO-based RideNN offered to improve the achievement with the elevated precision of 92.5%, the recall of 95.4%, the F-measures of 94%, and the smallest computation time of 135.654 s.},

These problems are becoming increasingly serious with the development of 4G LTE and 5G communication technologies. Although many efforts are made to improve the resilience to cyber attacks, there are still many unsolved challenges. This paper first identifies some major security attacks on intelligent connected vehicles. Then, we investigate and summarize the available defences against these attacks and classify them into four categories: cryptography, network security, software vulnerability detection, and malware detection. Remaining challenges and future directions for preventing attacks on intelligent vehicle systems have been discussed as well.},

  abstract = {Existing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) based communication suffers from various security and performance issues, hence Cluster based Communication is preferred nowadays. However, Cluster based Communication adds extra overhead and burden on the Cluster Head (CH) in dense network scenarios which eventually introduces delay and hinders network performance. To reduce the overburdening of single CH, a multi cluster head scheme is proposed in which multiple nodes in a cluster can act as CH to share the load of single CH. For a selection of stable CH, Hybrid Fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision making approach (HF-MCDM) is proposed in which Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS methods are clubbed together for optimal decision making. Further because of association of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) with life-critical applications, there is a dire need for a security framework to detect various malevolent attacks. Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) like Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the approaches for curbing such attacks. These intrusion detection based mechanism can be combined with various existing optimization techniques to improve their performance, and Dolphin Swarm Algorithm is one such approach. Dolphins have many significant biological features like echolocation, exchange of information, coordination, and division of labor. These biological features combined with swarm intelligence can be utilized for optimizing the detection and accuracy of SVM based IDS. So in this paper, a Multi-Cluster Head anomaly based IDS optimized by Dolphin Swarm Algorithm has been proposed and its results are compared with various existing Security frameworks in terms of parameters like false positive, detection rate, detection time, etc. and it is observed that the proposed approach performs better.},

Vehicles are composed of many electrical and electronic hardware modules. With integrating mobile vehicles, CPSs can be extended to realize more remote tasks. Network slicing (NS) is recognized as the key enabler towards the agile enabler of vehicles-assisted CPSs. In NS, one crucial technical issue is the slice resource allocation. Intelligent approaches, such as deep learning (DP), emerge and can be adopted to allocate slice resource allocation. In addition, due to the heterogeneity nature of physical elements in CPSs, security is strongly required to be addressed. On these basis, secure and intelligent slice resource allocation in vehicles-assisted CPSs is researched in this paper. At first, system models of vehicles-assisted CPSs with NS scheme and slices are described. Then, the intelligent resource allocation framework, abbreviated as Sec-Slice-Intell, is proposed and described. The goal of Sec-Slice-Intell framework is to achieve secure resource allocation per slice for NS-enabled CPSs. In order to validate the merits of the proposed framework, evaluation work is conducted and illustrated, in the form of simulation.},

  abstract = {In recent times, the machine learning (ML) community has recognized the deep learning (DL) computing model as the Gold Standard. DL has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of machine learning, achieving remarkable results in various complex cognitive tasks that are comparable to, or even surpassing human performance. One of the key benefits of DL is its ability to learn from vast amounts of data. In recent years, the DL field has witnessed rapid expansion and has found successful applications in various conventional areas. Significantly, DL has outperformed established ML techniques in multiple domains, such as cloud computing, robotics, cybersecurity, and several others. Nowadays, cloud computing has become crucial owing to the constant growth of the IoT network. It remains the finest approach for putting sophisticated computational applications into use, stressing the huge data processing. Nevertheless, the cloud falls short because of the crucial limitations of cutting-edge IoT applications that produce enormous amounts of data and necessitate a quick reaction time with increased privacy. The latest trend is to adopt a decentralized distributed architecture and transfer processing and storage resources to the network edge. This eliminates the bottleneck of cloud computing as it places data processing and analytics closer to the consumer. Machine learning (ML) is being increasingly utilized at the network edge to strengthen computer programs, specifically by reducing latency and energy consumption while enhancing resource management and security. To achieve optimal outcomes in terms of efficiency, space, reliability, and safety with minimal power usage, intensive research is needed to develop and apply machine learning algorithms. This comprehensive examination of prevalent computing paradigms underscores recent advancements resulting from the integration of machine learning and emerging computing models, while also addressing the underlying open research issues along with potential future directions. Because it is thought to open up new opportunities for both interdisciplinary research and commercial applications, we present a thorough assessment of the most recent works involving the convergence of deep learning with various computing paradigms, including cloud, fog, edge, and IoT, in this contribution. We also draw attention to the main issues and possible future lines of research. We hope this survey will spur additional study and contributions in this exciting area.},

However, MTC has to cope with significant security challenges due to heterogeneous data, public network connectivity, and inadequate security mechanism. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we have proposed a blockchain and garlic-routing-based secure data exchange framework, i.e., GRADE, which alleviates the security constraints and maintains the stable connection in MTC. First, the Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Nadam optimizer efficiently predicts the class label, i.e., malicious and non-malicious, and forwards the non-malicious data requests of MTC to the Garlic Routing (GR) network. The GR network assigns a unique ElGamal encrypted session tag to each machine partaking in MTC. Then, an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is applied to encrypt the MTC data requests. Further, the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS)-based blockchain is employed to store the machine's session tags, which increases the scalability of the proposed GRADE framework. Additionally, the proposed framework has utilized the indispensable benefits of the 6G network to enhance the network performance of MTC. Lastly, the proposed GRADE framework is evaluated against different performance metrics such as scalability, packet loss, accuracy, and compromised rate of the MTC data request. The results show that the GRADE framework outperforms the baseline methods in terms of accuracy, i.e., 98.9%, compromised rate, i.e., 18.5%, scalability, i.e., 47.2%, and packet loss ratio, i.e., 24.3%.},

VANETs enable different types of services through communication between vehicles and road side units. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) introduced this emerging technology to provide travelers comfort, safety, and infotainment services with improved traffic efficiency. Traditional VANET is not sufficient to handle dynamic and large scale networks with their fixed and embedded policies, and complex architecture. Open Network Foundation (ONF) is promoting the adoption of SDN through open standards' development by facilitating logical and centralized control of the entire network. SDN enables VANET to be a flexible and programmable network with the advent of new services and features. A centralized controller in the control plane controls the overall network functionalities and forwarding of data packets through the forwarding devices in the data plane. SDN enhances the efficiency of VANET and provides security benefits to VANET. But, it causes new security problems also with the integration of new technologies and architectural components in the network. This article provides a comprehensive review of VANET, SDN, and SDN based VANETs based on their architectural and implementation details. Then it explains the effect of SDN on the security of VANET when it is integrated with traditional VANET. This paper encompasses a comprehensive review of proposed approaches providing security solutions for SDN based VANETs and outlines emerging research issues as future directions.

Securing the communication taking place with the drones and especially in the network of a swarm, is of primary importance to allow a safe integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles into air traffic. Drones are subject to a range of attacks, from GPS jamming to application bug exploits. Among these attacks, and irrespective to whether they have already been implemented or not, communication is one of the main contributors, both as a vector and as a target. In this article, we use previous work on security threats concerning drones to identify two main types of attack in a network of drones: intrusion from the outside and network usage from inside. We demonstrate the robustness of the Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture facing most common attacks from the outside. In addition, we propose a traffic injection detection technique and corresponding countermeasures based on SDN flow counters. Finally, we present an innovative machine learning solution based on Random Forest Classifier to address insider attacks, relying solely on flow creation events. We propose two specific features that characterizes the activity in the network. They allow detecting common network attacks such as denial of service, port scanning and brute force and are easily available to the controller. Detection performance of these abnormal behaviors are promising, both in terms of true positive and false negative, and in terms of detection delay. Detection of these common attacks will allow tightening of security in such wireless network by denying further access to the network by rogue nodes.},

It involves establishing an inclusive transportation system to address many issues, like traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond environmental concerns, robust mobility management has social and economic advantages, fostering improved access to vital services like healthcare, education, and employment. Software-defined networking (SDN) presents a viable solution for enhancing MM within networks. Unlike traditional setups, SDN merges MM through a programmable control plane, streamlining network configurations and enabling features like handover, load balancing, and quality of service (QoS). The utilization of SDN technology extends to various facets of sustainable city networks, encompassing areas like network security, performance optimization, big data processing, energy efficiency, emergency management, carbon emissions reduction, intelligent services, and MM in vehicular networks. Despite the advantages of SDN-based mobility management, it's crucial to acknowledge the challenges and limitations posed by traditional MM methods that SDN aims to overcome. The paper explores SDN's potential in sustainable cities, focusing on how it can transform mobile device management, support various networking technologies, and evaluate the impact of SDN methods on existing MM systems, considering factors like scalability and compatibility. The paper asserts that SDN-based MM has substantial potential for promoting sustainable urban development. By centralizing control, adapting to changing conditions, and optimizing resource allocation, SDN can contribute to reduced energy consumption, lower carbon emissions, and more efficient urban mobility. It emphasizes the importance of addressing potential drawbacks to ensure successful implementation in sustainable cities.},

Those attacks and events can severely compromise the performance of IdPs, affecting legitimate users. Existing solutions either ignore such events, statically improving the performance of only specific IdP operations, or tolerate a predetermined number of failures, employing extra hardware resources purchased to replicate IdPs services.

Smart cities efficiently manage assets, services, and resources with better IoT technologies and new smart devices. However, their deployment elevates the potential security threats making IoT smart city projects vulnerable to disparate attacks. Hence, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) must be developed for IoT-enabled smart cities to alleviate IoT-associated security attacks. Achieving high-level detection accuracy and lower training time are significant challenges in IDS. However, the existing traditional IDS are inefficient in handling them. This paper proposes a hybrid optimization and deep-learning-centric IDS to face these challenges in IoT-enabled smart cities. The dataset initially undergoes pre-processing to acquire an effective and accurate IDS. Then, feature selection and clustering are performed utilizing the Hybrid Chicken Swarm Genetic Algorithm (HCSGA) and MinK-means Algorithm. Lastly, the transformed data is loaded to the Deep Learning-based Hybrid Neural Network (DLHNN) classifier, classifying the normal and attack data. The proposed model is validated with the NSL-KDD dataset and the experimental outcome shows the efficiency of the proposed IDS compared with similar state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract = {Autonomous Vehicle has been transforming intelligent transportation systems. As telecommunication technology improves, autonomous vehicles are getting connected to each other and to infrastructures, forming Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). CAVs will help humans achieve safe, efficient, and autonomous transportation systems. However, CAVs will face significant security challenges because many of their components are vulnerable to attacks, and a successful attack on a CAV may have significant impacts on other CAVs and infrastructures due to their interconnectivity. In this paper, we conduct a survey on 189 papers from 2000 to 2020 to understand state-of-the-art CAV attacks and defense techniques. Of those 189 papers, 131 were directly concerned with attack models or defense strategies for CAVs. This survey first presents a comprehensive overview of security attacks and their corresponding countermeasures on CAVs. We then discuss the details of attack models based on the targeted CAV components of attacks, access requirements, and attack motives. Finally, we identify some current research challenges and trends from the perspectives of both academic research and industrial development. Based on our studies of academic literature and industrial publications, we have not found any strong connection between academic research and industry’s implementation of CAV-related security issues. While efforts from CAV manufacturers to secure CAVs have been reported, there is no evidence to show that CAVs on the market can defend against some novel attack models that the research community has recently found. This survey may give researchers and engineers a better understanding of the current status and trend of CAV security for CAV’s future improvement.},

  abstract = {Today, some cities around the world have tended to use new technologies and become smart city. New technologies improve the quality of citizens’ life. However, the use of any technology raises new issues and challenges. In a smart city, the vulnerable action of an individual or organization can put the entire city at risk. Due to the reliance of various components of smart cities on information and communication technology, cyber-security challenges (such as information leakage and malicious cyber-attacks) in this field affect smart cities behavior. Therefore, in order to respond to the enthusiastic acceptance of global smart city technologies, cyber security must develop in same direction. The aim of this paper is survey and discus on explanation of cyber security, smart cities, and survey of available relevant literature on security in that technology. For this purpose, the present study focuses on the four main components of a smart city, i.e. smart grid, Smart building, Smart transportation system, and Smart healthcare. In particular, summary of two deep learning method and cyber-security programs as well as technology correlation in smart cities are discussed. Furthermore, effective functional solutions in maintaining cyber-security and user privacy in smart cities are explained. The next progress trends of smart city with cyber security are described. Solutions need to be devised to address each of the security issues. The research in this study showed that meeting these challenges depends on the hard work of governments, developers of equipment and software and companies providing IT security services. In addition, designing flexible systems with high information protection capabilities is essential to prevent serious security incidents as these incidents can lead to disastrous financial, data, credit and loss of public trust.},

  abstract = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV), as an emerging technology, has gained much attention in recent years due to rapid advancements in computing paradigms, vehicular and wireless technologies. IoV integrates vehicles with the internet using a computing paradigm and enables vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, the increase in density and the highly dynamic nature of vehicles have led to exponential complexity in traffic management, data exchange, and route scheduling. Moreover, rapid advancements in vehicular technologies to manage, store, and exchange data have led to serious security concerns. Software-defined networking (SDN), as an emerging networking architecture, has been adopted to control and manage the dynamic nature of vehicles and provide diverse quality of service and security (QoSS). These services include better transportation, resource sharing, network verification, and secure programmability of SDN-based applications. It consists of a centralized controller which uses OpenFlow (OF) protocol and achieves a global view of all the devices in a domain area. However, the network is vulnerable to single point of failure (SPoF), network topology poisoning, denial of service attacks, etc. To counter these attacks, a distributed control plane architecture has been adopted. However, it brings many challenges, and one of the biggest challenges is achieving consensus on information exchange among the controllers controlling different domain areas. Therefore, adopting blockchain technology in SDN-based vehicular network (SDVN) is a viable solution to address the mentioned challenges. The inherent features of blockchain such as decentralization, trust-free, immutability, public auditing and consensus algorithms offer various security services to vehicular networks. Therefore, this survey focuses on different SDN control plane architectures, security services, and challenges in SDVNs. The state-of-the-art blockchain-based schemes focusing on security requirements in vehicular networks have been discussed. A summary of blockchain-based SDVNs have been presented. An analysis of SDN controllers, simulation tools, and blockchain platforms for Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) is made. Finally, future research issues, challenges, and lessons learnt have been discussed.},

The tree-based ML techniques with feature selection performed better than those without feature selection for IOV-based vehicular network traffic.

As a result, as smart vehicles have evolved and grown in popularity, so have the cyber threats that threaten them. Vehicles may communicate with other vehicles, road infrastructure, and other smart devices; as a result, the security of related equipment must be ensured. Researchers presented many articles investigating smart vehicle intrusion, anomaly, and attack detection methods. In most of these, researchers only examined the proposed detection methods on in-vehicle networks (IVNs) and external networks for smart ground vehicles. However, reviewing and analyzing the detection methods provided in all communications and connections related to smart ground/air vehicles is necessary. This paper examines the detection methods for in-vehicle networks, inter-vehicle networks, ground vehicle power stations, and the Internet of Drones (IoD). Besides, it analyzes recently published studies in the four categories: intrusion detection systems (IDSs), anomaly detection, attack detection, and hybrid detection methods in smart vehicles. The methods examined in this survey were published in 2018–2022 in reputable journals such as Elsevier, IEEE, Springer, ScienceDirect, etc. We examine datasets, simulations/implementations, and key evaluation criteria for each detection method studied. Also, we compare these methods using appropriate tables and diagrams and analyze the problems in detecting intrusions, anomalies, and attacks in smart vehicles. Finally, we address the research questions and discuss future research challenges.},

There is a need to efficiently select features from the attack dataset, which also needs to be further analyzed. Simply placing the features as input to the classification model will result in an irrelevant class with poor performance. In the paper, in order to select the effective features, we proposed a voting-based hybrid feature selection technique that was cross-analyzed by three correlation methods. The hybrid method not only reduces the dimensions of the features and removes redundancy among them, but also provides the best relevant features for classification. The deployment of a multilayer perceptron with genetic algorithm (MLP-GA) as a classifier outperforms the conventional classifiers by furnishing an accuracy of 98.8%, a false positive rate of 0.6%, and the capability of early detection. The proposed method has been comprehensively validated using various publicly available benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) aims to enhance the users’ quality of experience through proposing more sophisticated services ranging from guaranteeing the user safety to improving his comfort. The IoV ecosystem is complex, heterogeneous, and evolving. Many entities participate to compose its architecture (such as vehicles, humans, roadside units, ITS). Moreover, different communication types co-exist to ensure the IoV connectivity and continuity. This diversity leads to new security requirements that seem more complex to take into account and enlarge the attack surface of such ecosystem. Many security mechanisms should be considered to enforce the security of IoV environment at many levels: data, entities, communications, storage, etc.. Trust management is one of the potential security mechanisms that aims to increase the reliability within the IoV environment. The topic has been widely explored within the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, the VANET represents only one component of the IoV ecosystem. Thus, the approaches proposed for the VANET should be adapted to be applied for the IoV. Moreover, the advent of the emerging technologies like blockchain, cloud, SDN as well as artificial intelligence bring new opportunities to propose more relevant approaches within the trust management mechanisms within the IoV context. Accordingly, this survey deals with the literature about the trust management topic in vehicular environments. The scope considers the IoV environment as well as the relevant approaches proposed for the VANET context since it is one of the important component of the IoV ecosystem. We start by quickly reviewing the existing surveys about security of the vehicular environments. Then, we give a general overview about trust concepts. Afterwards, we present the security and trust challenges and attacks in the vehicular context. Later, we classify and compare the most relevant approaches related to the trust management for the IoV proposing a new taxonomy. We complete this survey by highlighting the open future directions and perspectives for research.},

  abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are still among the most dangerous attacks on the Internet. With the advance of methods for detecting and mitigating these attacks, crackers have improved their skills in creating new DDoS attack types with the aim of mimicking normal traffic behavior therefore becoming silently powerful. Among these advanced DDoS attack types, the so-called low-rate DoS attacks aim at keeping a low level of network traffic. In this paper, we study one of these techniques, called Reduction of Quality (RoQ) attack. To investigate the detection of this type of attack, we evaluate and compare the use of four machine learning algorithms: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with backpropagation, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB). We also propose an approach for detecting this kind of attack based on three methods: Fuzzy Logic (FL), MLP and Euclidean Distance (ED). We evaluate and compare the approach based on FL, MLP and ED to the above machine learning algorithms using both emulated and real traffic traces. We show that among the four Machine Learning algorithms, the best classification results are obtained with MLP, which, for emulated traffic, leads to a F1-score of 98.04% for attack traffic and 99.30% for legitimate traffic, while, for real traffic, it leads to a F1-score of 99.87% for attack traffic and 99.95% for legitimate traffic. Regarding the approach using FL, MLP and EC, for classification of emulated traffic, we obtained a F1-score of 98.80% for attack traffic and 99.60% for legitimate traffic, while, for real traffic, we obtained a F1-score of 100% for attack traffic and 100% for legitimate traffic. However, the better performance of the approach based on FL, MLP and ED is obtained at the cost of larger execution time, since MLP required 0.74 ms and 0.87 ms for classification of the emulated and real traffic datasets, respectively, where as the approach using FL, MLP and ED required 11’46” and 46’48” to classify the emulated and real traffic datasets, respectively.},

This complicated cyber-attack caused many system failures and service disruptions, resulting in billions of dollars of financial loss and irrecoverable reputation damage in recent years.

  abstract = {Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) model is easy to arrange and inexpensive answer for clever traffic control and traffic failure protective measures. Generally, the nodes present in VANET utilize broadcast protocols for effectively transmitting safety information, although nodes do not perform based on routing protocols. The misbehavior can produce through targeted attack in which aggressive vehicle can purposely send malevolent packets to damage. Moreover, due to the reason of dynamic behavior of nodes in VANET plus routing difficulties, unexpected misconduct also occurs owing to the software or hardware failures in vehicle. The challenges faced by existing techniques are provided here. VANET becomes a most significant concern to enhance the expediency, mobility, and security application in ITS. Precautions are further tough owing to its rapid mobility, wireless communication and large coverage of nodes. Also, the computational time required for executing independent operations are conspicuously maximum when, the number of vehicles is maximized. In order to overcome these challenges, in this paper, hybrid optimization-based Deep Maxout Network (DMN) is developed for attack classification in VANET. The Cluster Head (CH) selection and routing process is performed using designed hybrid optimization algorithm. The feature selection process is more significant in order to perform effective classification process. In addition, the attack classification is carried out using DMN and it is taught by introduced optimization algorithm. The developed optimization-based DMN model obtained better classification performance with precision and recall of 0.9395, and 0.9462 as well as routing performance with energy and trust of 0.2454J, and 0.4402.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) will be essential in building a smart city in the forthcoming Internet of Things (IoT) age. In reality, the IoV can successfully address several traffic issues. It is essential for maximizing the use of roads, cutting down on energy use and pollution, and promoting traffic safety. However, creating safe and immediate payments and communications is the main challenge with the IoV, especially with Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I). To examine the application of Blockchain as middle-ware amongst diverse stakeholders of intelligent transportation systems, this paper provides an approach for establishing secure payment and communication in response to this problem. Neural synchronization is used to enhance communication security. The architecture under consideration makes used to create a system for allowing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) interactions and transactions. Additionally, the efficiency and resistance of the suggested systems against typical security assaults are qualitatively tested in this paper. The key issues of V2X connections, such as safety and centralization, were addressed by the suggested method, according to computational testing. In this study, we also assessed the proposed solution's most crucial characteristics, including memory and power use, modifiability, secrecy, consistency, authenticity, processing time, and affordability. The purpose of this test is to determine if the technology can provide efficient and reliable IoV communication and parking payment. The results show that the suggested methods are quicker and much more than the state-of-the-art communication technologies.},

  abstract = {The concept of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has attracted the attention of many sectors such as the automotive industry, academia, engineering, etc., offering a wide variety of benefits, such as reduced congestion, safer driving, and less pollution. However, since the deployment of IoT based devices is in an open field, the IoV environments can be a vital issue in the absence of security protections. In this paper, we propose an efficient authentication scheme over blockchain, named EASBF, for secure fog computing-enabled internet of vehicles. Specifically, the proposed EASBF scheme consists of five phases: initialization, registration, mutual authentication, and exchanging keys, consensus, and certificate update. Based on the elliptic curve cryptography, one-way hash function, and blockchain technology, the EASBF scheme can achieve confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, privacy, anonymity, non-repudiation, and perfect forward secrecy. The EASBF scheme is robust against cyber attacks, including, DDoS attack, replay attack, man-in-the-middle attacks, identity theft attack, traffic analysis attack, masquerading attack, and session key disclosure attack. Both the AVISPA tool and the random oracle model are used in security analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the EASBF scheme in terms of two performance metrics, namely, computation overhead, communication overhead, and storage overhead.},

  abstract = {Usage of smart devices, expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) network, and its adoption in variety of applications grows exponentially day-by-day. It leads to various issues such as network privacy, security management, unreliable network management (NM) scheme, resource utilization, energy utilization, decentralization, transparency, and data interoperability. Development of the NM platform/framework for secure data dissemination in IoT networks is tedious due to heterogeneity and imbalanced IoT protocol stack. Recently, traditional network scheduling methods, Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and hybrid approaches are widely used for managing the IoT network. But, most of these approaches are controlled by a centralized server, which may not be appropriate due to the heterogeneity of the IoT devices. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, In this paper, we present a systematic survey on various NM schemes used to secure data dissemination for the IoT environment. We present a detailed taxonomy of all the existing NM schemes for IoT networks. Pros and cons of the traditional NM methods applicable for IoT environment are discussed in detail. The paper discusses a state-of-art survey on integrating blockchain (BC) technology in the existing IoT NM techniques. In this paper, our prime focus is to understand the potential of BC for enabling secured IoT management. Finally, a case study on BC implication for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) network using 6G is also discussed along with future directions.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, increasing urbanization has necessitated the social, environmental, and economic development of cities to enhance the Quality of Life (QoL) significantly and introduces the “Smart City” concept. It integrates Information and Communication Tools (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies to resolve urban challenges. The key goal is to make the most acceptable use of available resources and technologies to develop smart cities. An IoT-enabled application plays a crucial role here, but it has various security, privacy, latency, and reliability issues with a single-point-of-failure problem. The evolving technology blockchain can handle the aforementioned security and privacy issues and provide high-quality services due to several features like transparency, trust-free, decentralization, immutability, and others. The 6G communication network takes care of latency and reliability issues in the smart city with their unique characteristics such as latency (10–100 μs) and reliability (99.99999%). Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review for blockchain technology and IoT together functional to smart cities. First, state-of-art-the works and contextual information are introduced. Then, we proposed a blockchain-based decentralized architecture for IoT-integrated smart cities covering different application perspectives, such as smart grid, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), and healthcare 5.0 underlying 6G communication networks. Next, we describe the challenges of the proposed architecture respective to each application, as mentioned above. Finally, we collated the open research issues and future direction to efficiently integrate blockchain into IoT-envisioned smart cities.},

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose SG-PBFT (Score Grouping-PBFT), a secure and efficient distributed consensus algorithm for blockchain applications in the IoV. The distributed structure can reduce the pressure on the central server and decrease the risk of single-node attacks. The SG-PBFT consensus algorithm improves the traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm by optimizing the PBFT consensus process and using a score grouping mechanism to achieve a higher consensus efficiency. The experimental results show that the method can greatly improve the consistency efficiency and effectively prevent single-node attacks. Specifically, when the number of consensus nodes reaches 1000, the consensus time of our algorithm is only about 27% of what is required for the state-of-the-art PBFT consensus algorithm. Our proposed SG-PBFT algorithm is versatile and can be used in other application scenarios which require high consensus efficiency.},

The connectivity of each and every piece of technology in the environment with Internet, has opened many avenues of research and development. Applications, algorithms, trust models, devices, all have evolved to accommodate the demands of user needs in the most optimal way possible. However, one thing still remains constant: host-centric communication. It is the most predominant way of communication in Internet today. With evolution of everything else, host based communication has been stretched to limits, and exploration of new models have been underway for sometime. Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a major contender for the future Internet architecture, where content is the basic element regardless of its location (host). It intends to offer in-network caching, inherent mobility, multicast support, and content based security as part of design and not add-on functionality. In recent years, numerous efforts have been made to integrate IoT with ICN as the communication model. In this paper, we provide a detailed and systematic review of IoT–ICN research. We investigate ICN as communication enabler for IoT domain specific use cases, and the use of ICN features for the benefit of IoT networks. These include IoT device & content naming, discovery, and caching. We also survey synchronization, interoperability, publish/subscribe communication, quality of service, security, and mobility of IoT devices with ICN perspectives.

Selecting the best action to update a particle is a challenging responsibility in solving real-world NP-Hard problems. The selection process in meta-heuristic algorithms is predominantly random or quasi-random, which is not suitable enough. The Learning-Automata (LA) is a mechanism to make the selection process more dynamic. The LA chooses the most optimal action regarding history and status and balances exploration and exploitation intelligently. In the current paper, a neoteric LA-based hybrid optimization algorithm is presented for global optimization problems. In the proposed algorithm, the artificial Jellyfish search algorithm (JS) and Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA) are rectified to reduce their computational complexity while retaining their strengths. Furthermore, the LA’s probability vector is augmented to make it more efficient. Afterward, the JS and MPA algorithm are redeveloped using the proposed LA mechanism. The proposed LA-based hybrid is tested on thirty-eight low- and high-dimensional benchmark functions compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, statistically and visually. Moreover, proficiency of the proposed LA-based hybrid algorithm is investigated on the data clustering problem. The proposed algorithm is applied to ten datasets, and the results are compared with competitor algorithms using various metrics. The experimental results exposed the preponderance of the proposed LA-based hybrid algorithm.},

To make the whole IoT infrastructure secure, efficient, robust cryptographic techniques are developed and required to handle data authentication, data privacy, confidentiality, integrity, etc. Furthermore, with the large-scale connectivity and group key management policy, cryptographic processes like Signcryption techniques used for authentication and confidentiality increase the overhead complexity of the network resources.

However, the development of drone technology is associated with vulnerabilities and threats due to the lack of efficient security implementations. Moreover, the complexity of UAVs in software and hardware triggers potential security and privacy issues. Thus, posing significant challenges for the industry, academia, and governments.

In particular, for each level, we thoroughly investigate (1) common vulnerabilities affecting UAVs for potential attacks from malicious actors, (2) existing threats that are jeopardizing the civilian application of UAVs, (3) active and passive attacks performed by the adversaries to compromise the security and privacy of UAVs, (4) possible countermeasures and mitigation techniques to protect UAVs from such malicious activities. In addition, we summarize the takeaways that highlight lessons learned about UAVs’ security and privacy issues. Finally, we conclude our survey by presenting the critical pitfalls and suggesting promising future research directions for security and privacy of UAVs.},

The data generated through such edge devices should be stored securely in Electronic Health Server (EHS) for further analysis and knowledge inference by medical professionals. Thus designing access control techniques that prevent unauthorised access at the cloud and device level is crucial. Interoperability concern in the IoMT development cycle is becoming a focus of interest for many researchers because most devices and underlying protocols are highly heterogeneous. Lack of worldwide acceptable protocol standards is another major issue in dealing with platform interoperability. In this study, the authors describe the various existing device and data access control strategies such as RBAC (Role Based Access Controlling), CaPBAC (Capability-Based Access Controlling), and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Controlling), etc. This article majorly surveys the literature from 2000 to 2020 on various access controlling and Interoperability aspects as they are potential players of modern IoT applications. The study also comprehensively discusses the state-of-the-art strategies that provide platform interoperability followed by crucial implementation challenges.

  abstract = {Vehicular communication is one of the essential technologies for increasing road safety, traffic efficiency, and comfort for pedestrians and drivers. In this context, the internet of vehicles is an emerging paradigm. However, with advances in vehicular communication, security threats have also emerged. Several vulnerabilities exist in vehicular communications, including Denial of Service (DoS), black hole attacks, and fabrication attacks. A malicious attack alters the packet information in a fabrication attack, causing congestion and high delays in the vehicular network. We propose two algorithms to protect the routing protocols in a vehicle-to-vehicle scenario against several attacks that target confidentiality, authentication, privacy, and integrity. The first algorithm detects the malicious behavior of each vehicle by calculating the percentage of modified destination addresses. If it exceeds a predetermined threshold, this vehicle is classified as malicious. Otherwise, it is a normal vehicle. The second algorithm detects malicious modifications based on the Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) by monitoring the SIR value, adjusting the distance, altering the power received, and changing the transmitted power value. We performed simulations using the SUMO 0.22 simulator and Network Simulator (NS). The results obtained show an improvement in End-to-End (E2E) delay, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and reduced overhead.},

Following the trend, it is evident that 6G will emerge as highly softwarized and open networks allowing the participation of multiple stakeholders. This undoubtedly will make 6G more flexible, agile, autonomous, intelligent, and cost-efficient networks. However, the programmability and openness will make 6G networks more prone to issues like security, privacy, traceability, interoperability, auditability, resource manageability, spectrum efficiency, and 3D mobility. To address these issues, a deep integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks is foreseen. Thus, we aim to put together blockchain and 6G under a magnifying lens to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of blockchain in the 6G ecosystem. We begin by providing an overview of the envisioned 6G networks and blockchain technology. Next, we present a high-level view of the role of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements. Following that, we conduct an in-depth study on how the blockchain can provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized underpinning to various technical aspects and use cases of 6G. Thereafter, we discuss the deployment challenges to be faced while integrating blockchain in 6G and the possible solutions. Finally, future research directions are expounded to set the floor for further advancements in the blockchainized 6G.},

Consequently, many enterprises cannot afford it. A compromise solution then is a hybrid networking environment (a.k.a.

Recently, hSDN has been seen as a viable networking solution for a diverse range of businesses and organizations. Accordingly, the body of literature on hSDN research has improved remarkably.

  abstract = {Network operators and researchers constantly search for platforms to evaluate future deployments and test new research ideas. When experimenting, they usually face challenges in deciding on an appropriate platform to validate the advantages and limitations of their proposed system. These challenges include finding an experimentation environment that balances traffic realism, scalability, and cost. An experimenter can evaluate systems, protocols, and security implementations using simulators, emulators, or testbeds to validate the expected behavior of the proposed idea. Simulators and emulators provide a controlled environment to conduct reproducible experiments but lack realism. Testbeds provide realism and scale depending on the available resources. However, real equipment can be costly and unavailable for many experimenters. The inability to test networking ideas in a realistic environment at a large scale presents a barrier for companies, institutions, and network vendors to implement new features, thus, slowing down innovation. In the past few decades, the networking community developed new platforms to test new ideas and deployments at scale, with realism, and at lower costs. These platforms also enable the instruction of networking concepts, cybersecurity, distributed computing, storage systems, and science applications. From the learner’s side, practical hands-on experience is required to internalize concepts and improve troubleshooting skills. Learning these concepts can be challenging due to the multidisciplinary nature of networking instruction, where a learner must have a background in several computing areas (e.g., operating systems, programming languages, and computer architecture). This paper presents experimentation platforms used to conduct research in computer networks and evaluates the potential of these platforms for instructing networking courses. This paper examines the literature and presents a taxonomy of network experimentation platforms. It also discusses challenges, analyzes the limitations, and suggests future perspectives by providing an overview of the tools, a description of the underlying resources (i.e., hardware and software), and a summary of the supported experiments. The paper aims to assist experimenters and educators in deciding which platform is more suitable for their experimentation needs and discuss the challenges and future directions related to the network experimentation platforms.},

As an immediate benefit, it improves network reliability and latency by enabling data access and processing rapidly and efficiently near IoT devices. However, it comes with several issues stemming from the complexity, the security, the energy consumption, and the instability due to the decentralization of service localization. Furthermore, the multi-resource allocation and task scheduling make this task the furthest from being straightforward. Blockchain has been envisioned to enforce trustworthiness in diverse IoT environments. However, high latency and high energy costs are incurred to process IoT transactions. This paper introduces a novel Blockchain-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to enable energy-aware task scheduling and offloading in an Software Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled IoT network. The Asynchronous Actor–Critic Agent (A3C) DRL-based policy achieves efficient task scheduling and offloading. The latter is in symbiosis with Proof-of-Authority Blockchain consensus to validate IoT transactions and blocks. By doing so, we improve reliability and low latency and achieve energy efficiency for SDN-enabled IoT networks. The A3C policy combined with the Blockchain is proved theoretically. Carried out experiments put forth that our approach offers 50% better energy efficiency, which outperforms traditional consensus algorithms, i.e., Proof of Work and PBFT, in terms of throughput and network latency and offers better scheduling performance.},

  abstract = {In the diverse range of surveillance applications, large-scale deployment of next-generation communication technologies and the fast-growing development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned as key innovations in the adoption of beyond-fifth generation (B5G) and 6G communication. Due to its self-reliance and versatility, a complex communication network can be formulated strategically to improve the application features of drone technology, including search-and-rescue, mission-critical services, and military surveillance. In recent times, technological advancements in hardware and software infrastructure have gained momentum toward seamless information interaction in aerial communication. Unfortunately, the recurrent process of user authentication causes severe communication instability in an unmanned aerial ad hoc network (UAANET) leading to some serious cyber threats, such as buffer overflow, denial of service, and spoofing. Therefore, building secure and reliable authentication is inevitable in order to protect drone-aided healthcare service environments. To protect aerial zones and improve security efficiency, this paper designs robust lightweight secure multi-factor authentication (RL-SMFA). The proposed RL-SMFA utilizes an AI-enabled, secure analytics phase to verify the genuineness of drone swarms for the ground control station. While protecting communication with drone vehicles, we also observe that power consumption by drones is reduced to a large extent. Using formal verification under a random oracle model, we show that the proposed RL-SMFA can functionally resist system vulnerabilities and constructively decrease the computation and communication costs of the UAANET. Lastly, the simulation study using ns3 shows that the proposed RL-SMFA achieves better performance efficiencies in terms of throughput rate, packet delivery ratio, and end-to-end delay than other state-of-the-art approaches to discovering a proper link establishment.},

This paper deeply analyzed the current state of the art about the existing security and privacy solutions tailored to 5G.

Following the philosophy of design for user, we propose a Social Selfishness Aware Routing (SSAR) algorithm to cope with user selfishness and provide good routing performance in an efficient way. To select an effective forwarding node, SSAR considers both users’ willingness to forward and their contact opportunity, and derives a metric with mathematical modeling and machine learning techniques to measure the forwarding capability of the mobile nodes. Moreover, SSAR formulates the data forwarding process as a Multiple Knapsack Problem with Assignment Restrictions (MKPAR) to satisfy user demands for selfishness and performance. Trace-driven simulations show that SSAR allows users to maintain selfishness and achieves good routing performance with low transmission cost.},

Fog computing is a notion that solves cloud computing’s limitations by offering low latency to IoT network user applications. However, the significant number of networked IoT devices, the large scale of the IoT, security concerns, users’ critical data, and heterogeneity in this extensive network significantly complicate the implementation. The IoT-Fog architecture consists of fog devices (servers) at the fog layer, which decreases network utilization and response time due to their closeness to IoT devices. However, as the number of IoT and fog devices under the IoT-Fog architecture grows, new security concerns and requirements emerge. Because incorporating fog computing into IoT networks introduces some vulnerabilities to IoT-Fog networks, the nodes in the fog layer are the target of security threats. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a novel paradigm that decouples the data plane from control plane, resulting in better programmability and manageability. Attack defense mechanisms can be implemented in the IoT-Fog network without SDN. But SDN paradigm provides the IoT-Fog with some characteristics that facilitate counterattacks. This survey briefly explains some works that utilized the SDN features in the IoT-Fog network for security threats in the IoT-Oriented fog layer. To this end, we examine IoT-Fog, SDN, and SDN-based IoT-Fog networks. We describe security threats in IoT-Fog networks and briefly explain the vulnerabilities and attacks in the fog layer. Then, we describe the fog layer’s most common IoT-Fog security defense mechanisms. Following that, we present the SDN features, explore how SDN can help defensive mechanisms in IoT-Fog networks, and categorize the works based on the SDN features they use.

The pervasive aspect of these drones is due to their ability to answer people’s needs. Drones are providing users with a bird’s eye that can be activated and used almost anywhere and at any time. However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike. The probability and frequency of these attacks are both high and their impact can be very dangerous with devastating effects. Therefore, the need for detective, protective and preventive counter-measures is highly required. The aim of this survey is to investigate the emerging threats of using drones in cyber-attacks, along the countermeasures to thwart these attacks. The different uses of drones for malicious purposes are also reviewed, along the possible detection methods. As such, this paper analyzes the exploitation of drones vulnerabilities within communication links, as well as smart devices and hardware, including smart-phones and tablets. Moreover, this paper presents a detailed review on the drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage in multiple domains (i.e civilian, military, terrorism, etc.) and for different purposes. A realistic attack scenario is also presented, which details how the authors performed a simulated attack on a given drone following the hacking cycle. This review would greatly help ethical hackers to understand the existing vulnerabilities of UAVs in both military and civilian domains. Moreover, it allows them to adopt and come up with new techniques and technologies for enhanced UAV attack detection and protection. As a result, various civilian and military anti-drones/UAVs (detective and preventive) countermeasures will be reviewed.},

  abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN), which has been successfully deployed in the management of complex data centers, has recently been incorporated into a myriad of 5G networks to intelligently manage a wide range of heterogeneous wireless devices, software systems, and wireless access technologies. Thus, the SDN control plane needs to communicate wirelessly with the wireless data plane either directly or indirectly. The uncertainties in the wireless SDN control plane (WCP) make its design challenging. Both WCP schemes (direct WCP, D-WCP, and indirect WCP, I-WCP) have been incorporated into recent 5G networks; however, a discussion of their design principles and their design limitations is missing. This paper introduces an overview of the WCP design (I-WCP and D-WCP) and discusses its intricacies by reviewing its deployment in recent 5G networks. Furthermore, to facilitate synthesizing a robust WCP, this paper proposes a generic WCP framework using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) principles and presents a roadmap for future research.},

  abstract = {Today’s digital world and evolving technology has improved the quality of our lives but it has also come with a number of new threats. In the society of smart-cities and Industry 4.0, where many cyber–physical devices connect and exchange data through the Internet of Things, the need for addressing information security and solve system failures becomes inevitable. System failures can occur because of hardware failures, software bugs or interoperability issues. In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of “smart-troubleshooting” that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying fault—causes and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.},

  abstract = {Name data networking (NDN) is one of the proposed ICN based future Internet architecture aims to substitute our current TCP/IP based Internet. The recent advancements in technology reduced the cost to connect to the Internet and made it feasible to connect a wide variety of devices that leads to rapid growth in hand-held devices and exponentially increased Internet users. The Internet usage pattern has also changed dramatically in the last decade and a considerable proportion of Internet traffic consists of video files only. TCP/IP based Internet was designed to communicate between point to point entities and mobility, multicast support, security, and a tremendous amount of Internet traffic was not considered at that time. The mismatch between Internet usage requirements and current Internet architecture motivated researchers to come up with content based new sustainable Internet architecture. NDN is designed from a clean slate and supposed to overcome the shortcomings while leverage strength present in TCP/IP based Internet architecture. NDN is a request-driven architecture where users request for content using names without concern about host. This article presents a detailed survey on NDN architecture, protocols, and previously proposed strategies. It also offers a comparative study on proposed strategies for naming, content caching, inter and intradomain routing, forwarding, and security. This survey uses a bottom-up approach and a new taxonomy for comparative analysis and assessment to present insights about the differences between the existing strategies and protocols proposed for NDN. The survey also explored the present applications and ongoing research and suggests future research directions.},

IoT-based UAV network system is used for surveillance, monitoring, payload delivery, and much more which generate a plethora of sensitive information which can be obtained by adversaries in the middle. The communication between UAVs and GCS is vulnerable to security threats using jamming and eavesdropping attacks. The message between UAV and GCS is not enciphered which makes them error-prone. Attacks like GPS (Global Positioning System) spoofing can be possible by sending fake coordinates to trick UAV’s control. Although much effort has been made toward UAV security. However, there is a dearth of descriptive reviews on secure communication in IoT-based UAV networks. The purpose of this paper is to find and examine peer-reviewed literature that discusses previous six-year established papers with existing attacks such as physical, and logical attacks with suggested solutions such as trajectory planning, lightweight schemes, solutions based on blockchain, quantum cryptography, etc. This paper analyzes the secure communication network between UAVs by systematically answering research questions based on the research methodology for the relevant study.

We summarize pros and cons of the same or different types of concerns and considerations for wireless intrusion detection with respect to specific attributes of target wireless networks including wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless personal area networks (WPANs), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), ad hoc networks, mobile telephony, wireless mesh networks (WMNs) and cyber physical systems (CPSs). Next, we summarize the most and least studied wireless IDS techniques in the literature, identify research gaps, and analyze the rationale for the degree of their treatment.

Thus, SDN/NFV paradigm has been investigated to seek whether network services could be efficiently delivered, managed, and disseminated to the end users. Internet of Things (IoT) is justifiably associated with the SDN/NFV augmentation to make this task enriched. However, factors related to edge-cloud communication and network services have not been effectively mitigated until now.

  abstract = {The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a network paradigm where drones will fly over well-defined airways. The Jamming Attack (JA) poses a severe risk to IoD, affecting the drone’s trajectory. Although JA has been investigated in UAV-based networks, the current solutions consider the airspace free to fly, whereas IoD allows drones to fly over constrained airspace, named airways. This study investigates the impact of JA over IoD, mainly regarding the drone path planning and, therefore, the drone trajectory. Also, we conduct a thorough discussion regarding the current challenges. To overcome these challenges, we propose the IoD-JAPM, an airway-aware protection mechanism against JA on the IoD, ranging from analyzing the airway’s availability to the potential reformulation of the drone path planning. We perform an experimental evaluation through simulations to compare IoD-JAPM with a baseline solution and an existing approach that considers the airspace free to fly, varying the IoD topology and the number of jammers in the environment. We analyze four different metrics to measure at what level IoD-JAPM can mitigate a JA. Through the results, we observe a relation between the impact of JA on the drone path planning and the robustness of the topology, where the more restricted the topology, the more impact JA causes. Also, IoD-JAPM mitigates the effects of JA on path planning, causing few reformulations or even flight cancellations. Specifically, IoD-JAPM prevents all drones from being attacked when the environment has one jammer and mitigates the attack at 30% for two jammers. Furthermore, IoD-JAPM overcomes the baseline study regarding the increasing drone flight distance, and power consumption. Since the drone propellers affect most of the drone battery, the more the flight distance the more the power consumption. Also, the results reinforce that “free-to-fly” approaches cannot be applied in airway-oriented environments with strong jamming signals. In a nutshell, IoD-JAPM represents a robust protection mechanism against JA considering the aerial space defined through airways, advancing the state of the art of IoD-based protection mechanisms against JA.},

In this case, the distributed manufacturing leads to different challenges such as control between production sites. Based on the cloud infrastructure usage for distributed production systems, the product reliability handling is vital. Moreover, AM is used to produce safety–critical systems components and this product type defines AM as an interesting attack target. This study presents a new extension of uncertain Business Process Management System (uncertain BPMS) architecture for detecting anomaly using this extension capability. This extension has a new component as event-based anomaly detector, where intrusion detection can take place through an integration of process mining and game theory techniques. The proposed component could operate based on pre-processor, conformance checker, and anomaly detection optimizer modules. These modules can intelligently control the AM process activities between expected behavior and actual behavior using distributed event logs, a hybrid of highly accurate algorithms such as Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO), firefly, and AdaBoost algorithms inside the game theory modeling approach. In this case, the game theory technique as an optimizer provides optimal selection strategies for the proposed component to detect untrusted behaviors. The results of the new extension execution on a case study and its evaluation using Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution indicate that the proposed anomaly detector component is highly accurate in anomaly detection for AM process activities and can detect more attacks successfully through guidance of the game theory framework in the system.},

PDS are a group of data structures that are extremely useful for Big data and streaming applications in order to avoid high-latency analytical processes. These data structures use hash functions to compactly represent a set of items in stream-based computing while providing approximations with error bounds so that well-formed approximations get built into data collections directly. Compared to traditional data structures, PDS use much less memory and constant time in processing complex queries. This paper provides a detailed discussion of various issues which are normally encountered in massive data sets such as-storage, retrieval, query,etc. Further, role of PDS in solving these issues is also discussed where these data structures are used as temporary accumulators in query processing. Several variants of existing PDS along with their application areas have also been explored which give a holistic view of domains where these data structures can be applied for efficient storage and retrieval of massive data sets. Mathematical proofs of various parameters considered in the PDS have also been discussed in the paper. Moreover, the relative comparison of various PDS with respect to various parameters is also explored.},

The IoT, devices can interconnect and communicate with each other, in a fully autonomous mode. This autonomy has made the IoT network vulnerable to various security threats. However, due to this autonomy, there is a strong need for reliable security and storage mechanism for authentication to exchange data between IoT devices. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient method known as SCAB-IoTA, which ensures identification and authentication of IoT devices and also provides secure communication in the open environment. Along with authentication and secure communication, the scheme also ensures data integrity. SCAB-IoTA used the blockchain and hybrid cryptosystem (the combination of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) cryptographic techniques) to enhance the security of IoT applications to prevent various attacks along with less computational, and storage overhead. Furthermore, we have a secure cluster of IoT devices based on angular distance (AD), so that devices can securely communicate without any interruption. A secure and robust trust mechanism has employed to build these clusters, where each IoT device has to authenticate itself before joining the cluster. The obtained results satisfy the IoT security requirements with 60% reduced computation, storage and communication cost compared with state-of-the-art methods. The security analysis illustrates that SCAB-IoTA withstands against various cyberattacks such as impersonation, message replay, man-in-the-middle, and botnet attacks.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts gave a new dimension to Blockchain applications. Subsequently, Blockchains evolved from decentralized cryptocurrency ledgers to platforms for developing decentralized applications. A decentralized application needs a variety of data from the real world that cannot be directly provided by smart contracts. Oracles provide a mechanism to input data to the smart contracts for decentralized applications in a trusted manner. Oracles are the entities that collect data from data sources, verify it and then transmit it to the Blockchain. The introduction of Oracles has brought back the issues of centralization, single point of failure and reliance on a trusted third party in the Blockchain ecosystem. Oracles have adopted different means to reduce centralization and achieve some trustless operating mechanisms involving decentralized algorithms based on voting or reputation. In this paper, we analyse the concept of the Blockchain Oracle problem, its effects on various Blockchain applications, various Oracle types and trust mechanisms. We also analyse some of the significant Oracles (like chainlink, provable), and their underlying mechanisms and compare them. In the end, we carry out a gap analysis and discuss some open research issues that must be addressed to achieve robust and secure decentralization.},

They are closely related to Internet of Things (IoT) systems, except that CPS focuses on the interaction between physical, networking and computation processes. Their integration with IoT led to a new CPS aspect, the Internet of Cyber-Physical Things (IoCPT). The fast and significant evolution of CPS affects various aspects in people’s way of life and enables a wider range of services and applications including e-Health, smart homes, e-Commerce, etc. However, interconnecting the cyber and physical worlds gives rise to new dangerous security challenges. Consequently, CPS security has attracted the attention of both researchers and industries. This paper surveys the main aspects of CPS and the corresponding applications, technologies, and standards. Moreover, CPS security vulnerabilities, threats and attacks are reviewed, while the key issues and challenges are identified. Additionally, the existing security measures are presented and analyzed while identifying their main limitations.

As a consequence, the congestion of the downstream transmission buffer in the data path of the node is highly correlated with the occupancy of the pending interest table (PIT). Therefore a systematic study and analysis of the PIT occupancy are of paramount importance to understanding congestion in CCN. In particular, in this paper, we propose an analytical model to estimate the PIT occupancy distribution via a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model that considers the effects of interest blocking, interest timeout and retries. To validate our model and assumptions, we invoke simulation with realistic traffic streams and show how the filtering effects of caching and interest aggregation make the Markov assumption reasonable in the nodes that are the most susceptible to experiencing congestion. To solve the model numerically, we use two alternative approximations, state space truncation and state aggregation, and then give some numerical results to demonstrate the accuracy of our approximations.},

However, most current operation and maintenance systems cannot reasonably evaluate and predict network security. In order to be able to evaluate and prevent the network security of the bridge BIM intelligent operation and maintenance system under the background of big data, this paper uses the KDD Cup99 data set and the network attack data in the bridge BIM network environment to simulate the method proposed in this paper. The comparison results verify that the network security risk perception method proposed in this paper can realize network security risk perception more accurately and efficiently. This paper proposes a data mining method based on Bayesian network algorithm to evaluate the risk value of the bridge BIM intelligent operation and maintenance system. During the period from 0 to 110 min, the network risk value increased from 0.003 to 0.91. It can be seen that with the deepening of the attack phase, the degree of network risk will also increase. This paper uses the detection rate, false negative rate, false positive rate, AUC and other indicators to conduct simulation experiments on the data prediction-based network security risk prediction algorithm and comparison algorithm proposed in this paper. Simulation experiments show that under the four simulation experiment environments (pl = pe = 0.01/0.15, n = 20/50), the AUC of this scheme is increased by 0.018, 0.053, 0.008 and 0.11, respectively.

  abstract = {Context:
The Internet of Things (IoT) comprises various computing devices that operate on a non-standard platform and can connect to wireless networks to transmit data. These devices typically have limited storage capacity, restricted network bandwidth, and a lower level of computing power, which can cause congestion in the network. Hence, it is crucial to have a congestion control mechanism in place to facilitate efficient data transfer in IoT networks.
Objective:
To address congestion in the IoT, this research attempts to offer an overview of several congestion detections, avoidance, and control-based routing protocol techniques.
Method:
A systematic mapping study was carried out to pinpoint relevant literature. From this process, 102 publications were identified as the most relevant studies of congestion detection, congestion avoidance, congestion control, routing protocol, congestion control in 6LoWPAN, and learning-based congestion control.
Results:
Most relevant articles are clustered based on congestion detection (10%), congestion avoidance (12%), congestion control (23%), avoiding congestion through routing protocol (14%), congestion control in 6LoWPAN (19%), and controlling the congestion through learning based methods (24%).
Conclusion:
Congestion control is necessary for IoT to maintain network stability, reliability, and performance. It helps to ensure that critical applications can operate seamlessly and that IoT devices can communicate efficiently without overwhelming the network. Congestion control algorithms ensure that the network operates within its capacity, preventing network overload and maintaining network performance.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades, Internet of Things (IoT) networks have grown exponentially. Although the devices have relatively low memory, resource, and processing capability, the trend is that nodes generate a large volume of data. That is where cloud technology comes into play to provide storage space. Because of its centralized nature and robustness, a large network operating with cloud assistance may be vulnerable. Due to rigid access control policies, the devices may be vulnerable to malicious activity. On the other hand, cloud technology provides a platform for such a security system to operate. A centralized secure architecture fails to consider mobile and edge devices within the context of these criteria. This raises numerous concerns about trusting third-party cloud intermediaries, which cause security and privacy leaks. The goal of this research is to look into the problem of blockchain consensus algorithms and their applicability in IoT with cloud-native infrastructure in the Ethereum and MultiChain variants. The significant challenge is scaling the core layer without sacrificing decentralization, security, or public verifiability. This type of testbed is used to investigate the impact of architectural design and consensus models in a lightweight IoT environment. Consensus in each IoT transaction remains the most important aspect of blockchain-enabled IoT networks. When the ledger is updated without privacy protection, transaction-oriented breaches can occur. Current practices for integrating finite IoT network resources into infrastructure-oriented blockchain implementations are flawed due to they are willing to sacrifice data security and integrity in order to save time and energy. This encourages researchers to investigate an improved lightweight block verification approach to the blockchain functional framework, that decreases processing needs, network latency, and network overhead substantially. As a result, the layer-3 consensus promotes blockchain to include the block with a 35% improvement in base layer block time efficiency and a 56% increase in throughput.},

However, this unrepresented growth is tinged by the uncertainty of possible challenges in security and privacy. In this work, we propose a novel blockchain-envisioned fine grained user access control scheme for data security and scalability in IIoT environment. The proposed scheme supports multiple attribute authorities and also a constant size key and ciphertext. The data gathered by the IoT smart devices are encrypted using the cipher-policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) and sent to their nearby gateway nodes. Later, the gateway nodes form the transactions from the encrypted data from the smart devices which are used to form partial blocks. The partial blocks are then forwarded to the cloud server(s) in the peer-to-peer (P2P) network to convert them into full blocks, which are verified, mined and added into the blockchain using the voting-based practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The proposed scheme also allows a user to access the secure data stored in the blocks into the blockchain using the CP-ABE mechanism. The security analysis demonstrates the robustness of the proposed scheme against various attacks, and the comparative study with related relevant schemes also highlights the advantage of the proposed scheme over existing approaches. Finally, a blockchain implementation of the presented scheme summarizes the computational costs for a varied number of transactions per block, and also for a varied number of blocks mined in the blockchain.},

In the first phase, a secure data aggregation through 6G sensors is performed at the data plane. Then, in the second phase, the aggregated data is sent to the 6G-enabled NFV control plane to leverage resource allocation to connected autonomous smart vehicles (CASVs) through edge nodes via service container operations. In the third phase, management plane operations are designed that includes registration and auction smart contracts (SC) for connected autonomous vehicle owner (CAVO) and CASVs over the BC with public/private pairs fetched from interplanetary file systems (IPFS). The proposed scheme is compared against existing NFV schemes like distant, edge, and SDN-based edge control. At 20 CASVs, 6Blocks achieves an edge-service latency of 0.05ms against 0.76ms, 0.27, and 0.15ms for cloud, edge, and SDN-edge schemes, respectively, with high connection density of 107 nodes, at maximum utilized IPFS bandwidth of 0.2 Mbps. Then, we validate the trust of our model through the automated validation of the internet security protocol and applications (AVISPA) tool and modeled the vehicle and sensor nodes. The obtained results show the efficacy of the proposed scheme against existing state-of-the-art approaches with respect to parameters such as network, security, transaction costs, and auction.},

Many application problems provide solutions. However, this also makes the original pure industrial system environment face more security risks. Considering the security of the CPS control layer, based on the principle of Bayesian hypothesis testing, a detection method for the tampering of the measurement data of the control layer is proposed. This method uses the prior knowledge of the parameters to make the model still usable under the condition of a small sample amount of data. At the same time, the judgment conclusions made can accurately give the probability value of the attack behavior, which can more intuitively explain the possibility of the current statement. Compared with the previous traditional hypothesis testing method, this method is in line with the background of the CPS attack, so it has practical advantages.},

  abstract = {In recent times, IoT has emerged as a new paradigm for the interconnection of heterogeneous, resource-constrained, and communication-capable smart devices. It has been anticipated as a key enabler for various domains of applications such as health care, automotive, agriculture, industrial operations, automation, energy, and the next generation of living. However, the current IoT applications face significant challenges in terms of the huge amount of collected data, intensive data exchange, security, privacy, centralized processing, and interoperability. To mitigate many of these issues, blockchain has been identified as a promising innovative technology. Blockchain, in conjunction with smart contracts, has received significant attention both from the industry and academia and offers features such as irreversibility, non-repudiation, proof of provenance, fault tolerance, pseudonymity, decentralized operations and decision-making, and distributed ledger. The integration of blockchain with IoT requires essential insights concerning the application areas, scalability, security, privacy, data college and storage, performance, and governance. Thus, this paper intends to expound on the opportunities and key aspects of using blockchain in the IoT landscape. Specifically, this paper surveys the utilization of blockchain for various IoT applications. Besides, the paper distinguishes different technical aspects and presents the associated research challenges. At last, future research directions are discussed depending on the lessons learned.},

This extension was also suggested to boost the standard of IoT system implementations thus decreasing energy consumption and latency for those applications that need fast responses. However, as stated in recent literature, Fog computing may have some important security and privacy challenges. On the other hand, Blockchain, which was generated and used in crypto-currencies, has been applied in a wider range of applications due to the security, privacy, distributed trust management, and reliability features provided. Among the applications, which have recently been attractive about blockchain is Fog computing. Blockchain in Fog computing may achieve a distributed and trusted, identity management, secure data, reputation, and payment systems. This survey discusses the state-of-the-art impact of the blockchain on the security and privacy of Fog computing. The findings elucidate the vision of blockchain in Fog computing-security and privacy-based enhancement and draw attention to open challenges and future research directions.},

To achieve a higher detection rate, the ability to design an improved detection framework is sought after, particularly when utilizing ensemble learners. Designing an ensemble often lies in two main challenges such as the choice of available base classifiers and combiner methods. This paper performs an overview of how ensemble learners are exploited in IDSs by means of systematic mapping study. We collected and analyzed 124 prominent publications from the existing literature. The selected publications were then mapped into several categories such as years of publications, publication venues, datasets used, ensemble methods, and IDS techniques. Furthermore, this study reports and analyzes an empirical investigation of a new classifier ensemble approach, called stack of ensemble (SoE) for anomaly-based IDS. The SoE is an ensemble classifier that adopts parallel architecture to combine three individual ensemble learners such as random forest, gradient boosting machine, and extreme gradient boosting machine in a homogeneous manner. The performance significance among classification algorithms is statistically examined in terms of their Matthews correlation coefficients, accuracies, false positive rates, and area under ROC curve metrics. Our study fills the gap in current literature concerning an up-to-date systematic mapping study, not to mention an extensive empirical evaluation of the recent advances of ensemble learning techniques applied to IDSs.},

This attack can impact the caching process in various ways, such as causing increased cache misses for legitimate users, delays in data retrieval, and exhaustion of resources in NDN routers. Despite the numerous countermeasures suggested in the literature for CPA, many of them have detrimental effects on the NDN components. In this paper, we introduce Q-ICAN, a novel intelligent technique for detecting and mitigating cache pollution attacks in NDN. More specifically, Q-ICAN uses Q-Learning as an automated CPA prediction mechanism. Each NDN router integrates a reinforcement learning agent that utilizes impactful metrics such as the variation of the Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) and the interest inter-arrival time to learn how to differentiate between malicious and legitimate interests. We conducted several simulations using NDNSim to assess the effectiveness of our solution in terms of Cache Hit Ratio (CHR), Average Retrieval Delay (ARD) and multiple artificial intelligence evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. The obtained results confirm that Q-ICAN detects CPA attacks with a 95.09% accuracy rate, achieves a 94% CHR, and reduces ARD by 18%. Additionally, Q-ICAN adheres to the security policy of the NDN architecture and consumes fewer resources from NDN routers compared to existing state-of-the-art solutions.},

We integrate the fifth-generation (5G) communication network with the proposed blockchain-based scheme to enable ultra-low latency, high reliability, and availability. We have incorporated the edge intelligence nodes (EINs) with blockchain for efficient data processing. We have used a random forest classifier model (RFCM) on the road accidents dataset to predict the accident severity, i.e., fatal, serious, and slight. It is based on road type, light condition, and vehicle movement to be shared among other AVs. We have considered various scenarios and performed the predictive analysis that needs to be secured by using blockchain technology. Results of the study demonstrate the accuracy of RFCM as 93%, the precision of 98%, 97%, and 87% for fatal, serious, and slight categories of accident severity, respectively. The results show that the proposed scheme with RFCM yields better accuracy of 93% than other existing classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost. The blockchain-based proposed system has been compared with the traditional approach based on parameters such as network latency, scalability, computation time, delay comparison for node validation, data storage latency, and data storage cost. Obtained results show that the proposed scheme enables the data sharing reliable, secure, and efficient for AVs and outperforms the blockchain and non-blockchain systems in terms of security and efficiency.},

This communication environment is not secure and has several vulnerabilities. The major issues in IV communication are trustworthiness, accuracy, and security of received and broadcasted data in the communication channel. In this article, we introduce blockchain technology to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with topologies similar to IV communication. Further, we propose a blockchain-technology-enabled IV communication use case. Blockchain technology is used to build a secure, trusted environment for IV communication. This trusted environment provides a secure, distributed, and decentralized mechanism for communication between IVs, without sharing their personal information in the intelligent transportation system. Our proposed method comprises of a local dynamic blockchain (LDB) and main blockchain, enabled with a secure and unique crypto ID called intelligent vehicle trust point (IVTP). The IVTP ensures trustworthiness among vehicles. Vehicles use and verify the IVTP with the LDB to communicate with other vehicles. For evaluation, we simulated our proposed blockchain technology-based IV communication in a common intersection deadlock use case. The performance of the traditional blockchain is evaluated with emphasis on real-time traffic scenarios. We also introduce LDB branching, along with a branching and un-branching algorithm for automating the branching process for IV communication.},

  abstract = {Presently, the interconnected networks in smart cities are increasing at a high pace using the Internet of Things (IoT), which allows the user to access the device from anywhere and gather the data. With such massive networks, data analysis plays a vital role in the real world to interpret and analyze the information, giving it a meaningful form. Such an extensive network of interconnected devices leads to a high probability of information theft and data alteration/manipulation through malicious attacks, leading to incorrect information floating over the network, resulting in misleading analysis. This may result is significant disaster in FOG computing environment resulting in failure of smart city applications like healthcare, smart traffic and many more. So, to over a model is required to identify the behaviors of attacker/malicious node. Many work are been proposed using clustering, game theory, fuzzy logic and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to solve this but they do not consider the spread of infection affecting the other nodes. In this work a pre-predator model to determine the malicious node in the network has been proposed. The model consists prey and predator, where prey consists of infected nodes, whereas predators are malicious objects. In IoT networks, the delay is not the real factor in the spread of infection due to the chaotic nature of the malicious objects. So to overcome this issue, delay differential equation modeling is used. The performance of proposed model is compared with fuzzy logic and game theory based existing models taking into time to detect malicious, rate of infection and Count of infected node detected as performance parameters. Results shows 5% and 8% reduction in number of infected nodes as compared to fuzzy logic and game theory-based approach and reduction of 9% in infection rate.},

  abstract = {Spectrum scarcity has been a major concern for achieving the desired quality of experience (QoE) in next-generation (5G/6G and beyond) networks supporting a massive volume of mobile and IoT devices with low-latency and seamless connectivity. Hence, spectrum sharing systems have been considered as a major enabler for next-generation wireless networks in meeting QoE demands. Specifically, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) has standardized coexistence of 4G LTE License Assisted Access (LAA) network with WiFi in the unlicensed 5 GHz bands, and the 5G New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) with WiFi 6/6E in 6 GHz bands. While most current coexistence solutions and standards focus on performance improvement and QoE optimization, the emerging security challenges of such network environments have been ignored in the literature. The security framework of standalone networks (either 5G or WiFi) assumes the ownership of entire network resources from spectrum to core functions. Hence, all accesses to the network shall be authenticated and authorized within the intra-network security system and is deemed illegal otherwise. However, coexistence network environments can lead to unprecedented security vulnerabilities and breaches as the standalone networks shall tolerate unknown and out-of-network accesses, specifically in the medium access. In this paper, for the first time in literature, we review some of the critical and emerging security vulnerabilities in the 5G/WiFi coexistence network environment which have not been observed previously in standalone networks. Specifically, independent medium access control (MAC) protocols and the resulting hidden node issues can result in exploitation such as service blocking, deployment of rogue base-stations, and eavesdropping attacks. We study potential vulnerabilities in the perspective of physical layer authentication, network access security, and cross-layer authentication mechanisms. This study opens a new direction of research in the analysis and design of a security framework that can address the unique challenges of coexistence networks.},

Different techniques have been proposed and so-called packet marking and IP tracing procedures have especially demonstrated a good capacity to face different malicious attacks. While host-based DoS attacks are more easily traced and managed, network-based DoS attacks are a more challenging threat. In this paper, we discuss a powerful aspect of the IP traceback method, which allows a router to mark and add information to attack packets on the basis of a fixed probability value. We propose a potential method for modeling the classic probabilistic packet marking algorithm as Markov chains, allowing a closed form to be obtained for evaluating the correct number of received marked packets in order to build a meaningful attack graph and analyze how marking routers must behave to minimize the overall overhead.},

However, the CUC has become more complex and increasingly critical to the digital transformation process of the enterprise’s database by a cybercriminal, we propose a novel technique that effectively detects CUC at the enterprise-level. The proposed technique is learning from the user’s behavior and builds a knowledge base system (KBS) which observe changes in the user’s operational behavior. For that reason, a series of experiments were carried out on the dataset that collected from a sensitive database. All empirical results are validated through well-known evaluation measures, such as (i) accuracy, (ii) sensitivity, (iii) specificity, (iv) prudence accuracy, (v) precision, (vi) f-measure, and (vii) error rate. The experiments show that the proposed approach obtained weighted accuracy up to 99% and overall error of about 1%. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently can detect CUC which may keep an organization safe from major damage in data through cyber-attacks.},

  abstract = {This research analyses new approaches to security enforcement in fifth generation (5G) architecture from end to end perspective. With the aim of finding a suitable and effective unified schema across the different network domains, it shows that policy control framework may become the cornerstone for the definition and enforcement of security policies in new 5G networks. The 5G core network architecture reference model is defined as a Service Based Architecture (SBA). The Policy Control Function (PCF) is a Network Function (NF) that constitutes, within the SBA architecture, a unique framework for defining any type of policies in the network and delivering those to other control plane NFs. In previous generations the policy control approach has been restricted to Quality of Service (QoS) and charging aspects. In contrast, the 5G system is now based on a unified policy control scheme that allows to build consistent policies covering the entire network. By utilizing the unified 5G policy framework we have found an effective security enforcement schema flexible to create new security policies, and agile to react to the constantly changing environment, across the end to end architecture. Within this schema we have defined mechanisms to apply the QoS principles to security use cases. We have also set up the user plane security enforcement within the session management and established security policies. Finally we have made proposals to extend the network analytics to security analytics. Our overall vision is to consider security as a quality element of the network.},

  abstract = {The new paradigm of fog computing was extended from conventional cloud computing to provide computing and storage capabilities at the edge of the network. Applied to vehicular networks, fog-enabled vehicular computing is expected to become a core feature that can accelerate a multitude of services including crowd-sensing. Accordingly, the security and privacy of vehicles joining the crowd-sensing system have become important issues for cyber defense and smart policing. In addition, to satisfy the demand of crowd-sensing data users, fine-grained access control is required. In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving crowd-sensing scheme for fog-enabled vehicular computing. The proposed architecture is made by a double layer of fog nodes that is used to generate crowd-sensing tasks for vehicles, then collect, aggregate and analyze the data based on user specifications. To ensure data confidentiality and fined-grained access control, we make use of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption with access update policy (CP-ABE-UP), which is a well-known one-to-many encryption technique. The policy update algorithm allows the fog nodes to outsource the crowd-sensing data to other fog nodes or to data users directly. We also adopted the ID-based signature tied to pseudonymous techniques to guarantee the authentication and privacy-preservation of the entities in the system. From the upper fog layer to the data user, we show that an information-centric networking (ICN) approach can be applied to maximize the network resources and enhance the security by avoiding unauthorized and unauthenticated data owners. The security analysis confirms that our approach is secure against known attacks, whereas the simulation results show its efficiency in terms of communication with little computational overhead.},

  abstract = {An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the fundamental building blocks in securing a network. A huge number of techniques have been proposed and implemented to improve the performance and accuracy of intrusion detection models. In recent years, efforts have been made to keep the attack surface as small as possible. However, the attack vectors have evolved in terms of complexity and diversity, and various intelligent techniques have been employed by the adversaries to exploit the ecosystems. This exploitation can either make the whole system dysfunctional or may lead to important information leakage. More specifically, with the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT), more heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices are interconnecting with each other. These devices have limited processing power and resources, particularly for detecting intrusions. Consequently, Swarm Intelligence (SI) based techniques have received considerable attention, especially in the past decade, as the SI approaches have achieved a decent success rate by optimizing various aspects of an IDS. This paper presents a systematic review with a thorough coverage of articles published between 2010 and 2020 of the state-of-the-art swarm intelligence approaches deployed in various attack surfaces for intrusion detection in various domains. The paper also presents a categorization in accordance with applicability of these SI approaches in improving various aspects of an intrusion detection process. Moreover, the paper also discusses the capabilities and features of various datasets used in experimentation. This aims to help researchers in assessing the capabilities and limitations of SI algorithms to identify security threats and challenges to design and implement an IDS for the detection of cyber attacks in various domains. Moreover, this will also help security individuals in differentiating SI based IDS with traditional ones. As such, the survey would be equally beneficial for the researchers working in the domain of swarm intelligence as well as cybersecurity. The survey highlights certain existing challenges and provides directions to address them effectively. In addition, new research directions are also identified.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) allows communication between devices, things, and any digital assets that send and receive data over a network without requiring interaction with a human. The main characteristic of IoT is the enormous quantity of data created by end-user’s devices that needs to be processed in a short time in the cloud. The current cloud-computing concept is not efficient to analyze very large data in a very short time and satisfy the users’ requirements. Analyzing the enormous quantity of data by the cloud will take a lot of time, which affects the quality of service (QoS) and negatively influences the IoT applications and the overall network performance. To overcome such challenges, a new architecture called edge computing — that allows to decentralize the process of data from the cloud to the network edge has been proposed to solve the problems occurred by using the cloud computing approach. Furthermore, edge computing supports IoT applications that require a short response time and consequently enhances the consumption of energy, resource utilization, etc. Motivated by the extensive research efforts in the edge computing and IoT applications, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review of edge and fog computing research in the IoT. We investigate the role of cloud, fog, and edge computing in the IoT environment. Subsequently, we cover in detail, different IoT use cases with edge and fog computing, the task scheduling in edge computing, the merger of software-defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) with edge computing, security and privacy efforts. Furthermore, the Blockchain in edge computing. Finally, we identify open research challenges and highlight future research directions.},

  abstract = {With the increasing connectivity in modern vehicle infrastructure, solutions are required to harden the vehicle’s electronic architecture against potential attacks. One of the most important concerns is to ensure vehicle systems take appropriate and safe actions to diminish the probability of cyber-attacks success and mitigate the ramifications of potential unauthorized access. In this work, we present a layered systematic approach to achieve these goals along with a real implementation on an electric motorcycle. The developed secure infrastructure involves secure interconnection mechanisms to ensure trustworthy communications for electronic control nodes; hardware firewall to prevent interference and unauthorized access from untrusted applications/firmware; separated OS instances for different execution environments to provide best possible support for apps with different requirements and to further isolate apps from each other; and finally secure deployment of apps/firmware to ensure that apps are deployed unaltered to the automotive platform. In particular, considering both in-vehicle’s units resource-constraints, in terms of cost and size, and security needs that emerge in open bus-based networks, we introduce a secure technology that helps to prevent cyber-attacks in automotive Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol which is often used in in-vehicle networks. This technology, which we call secure CAN (sCAN), respects standard CAN-bus and realizes security mechanisms implemented in software or hardware, while adding less than 1 ms latency on the communication. sCAN in synergy with on-chip hardware firewalling which controls authorization level of on-chip accesses, and finally, together with securing the deployment of firmware updating over the air, build a fully-layered approach for connected vehicles to protect system assets, such as application and device authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and availability.},

  abstract = {A Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is a widely used temporary network. It is simple to install and handle. However, its dynamic nature is more vulnerable to routing attacks than fixed networks. Many intrusion detection methods are available to tackle its vulnerability and attacks. These works used different statistical parameters and measured various performances to validate their methods. Existing works have different claims or validations. However, these works show ambiguities in performance comparison. There are many reasons for performance ambiguities, such as imbalanced distribution of samples, number of training samples, number of labels, etc., whereas these are executed on the same dataset. This paper presents deployment of the network, data generation, sample labeling, feature extraction, an intrusion detection method, and a performance reliability evaluation model. The evaluation model analyzes the performance and hardware dependability of intrusion detection methods, and it computes the performance reliability of related methods using a fuzzy logic system. The outcome shows that when one statistical performance increases, another performance decreases due to an imbalanced sample ratio. Therefore, the proposed evaluation model has analyzed the two best performances. It evaluates intrusion detection mechanisms and provides a comparative analysis with an approximate performance as scheme reliability. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed detection method is better than existing methods in terms of maintaining high scheme reliability.},

  abstract = {With an exponential increase in the usage of different types of services and applications in cloud computing environment, the identification of malicious behavior of different nodes becomes challenging due to the diversity of traffic patterns generated from various services and applications. Most of the existing solutions reported in the literature are restricted with respect to the usage of a specific technique applicable to single class datasets. But in real life scenarios, applications and services especially in cloud environment may have multi-class datasets. Moreover, non-linear behavior among the dataset attributes generates additional challenges for identification of nodes behavior, and it has not been exploited to its full potential in the existing solutions. This can lead to performance bottlenecks with respect to the identification of malicious behavior of different nodes. Motivated from these facts, this paper proposes an Ensemble Artificial Bee Colony based Anomaly Detection Scheme (En-ABC) for multi-class datasets in cloud environment. En-ABC has following components for identification of malicious behavior of nodes-(i) feature selection and optimization, (ii) data clustering, and (iii) identification of anomalous behavior of nodes. The feature selection and optimization model in En-ABC has been built using Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Unscented Kalman Filter (to handle the non-linear behavior of dataset attributes) respectively. Moreover, Artificial Bee Colony-based Fuzzy C-means clustering technique is used to obtain an optimal clustering based on two objective functions, i.e., Mean Square Deviation and Dunn Index (to handle the participation of attributes in multiple clustered datasets). Then, a profile of normal/abnormal behavior has been built using clustering results for detection of the anomalies. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme has been compared with the existing schemes (CM, SVM, ML-IDS and MSADA) using various parameters such as-detection, false alarm, and accuracy rates. Experimental results on benchmark (NSL-KDD, NAB and IBRL) and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) lies in the core of Industry 4.0, accelerating the convergence of formerly barricaded operational technology systems with modern information technology ones. Nevertheless, the increased connectivity in terms of both wired and wireless links and associated attack surfaces that comes along, requires higher security for safeguarding critical industrial systems and manufacturing lines from cyberattacks. In this rapidly evolving ecosystem, security testbeds have emerged as a versatile, cost-effective solution for investigating potential attack vectors and devising appropriate countermeasures, without putting the real system at risk. The present work seeks to address a prominent literature gap, namely, the lack of a systematic review regarding the use of wireless-oriented security testbeds in CPS. We contribute an overarching, manifold review on this topic from 2016 onward, examining the various literature works from diverse angles, namely, the wireless technologies used, the implemented attacks, the employed security controls, and more. The analysis is done on a per-sector basis, including water and wastewater systems, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, energy, maritime, unmanned aircraft systems, and others. Finally yet importantly, we discuss key takeaways, open issues, and challenges. The key observations of our analysis, including almost 50 articles, can be wrapped up into two salient points: on the one hand, wireless technologies are increasingly penetrating into the CPS domain as an orthogonal, versatile solution to their wired counterparts, but on the other, they widen the window of opportunity for threat actors targeting wireless links. In this context, testbed thoroughness and security as a trade-off seem to be of major importance, alongside a modular, possibly sector-neutral reference architecture that overarches the peculiarities of CPS. Overall, to our knowledge, this work provides the first full-fledged survey on the use of wireless-oriented security testbeds in CPS, and it is therefore anticipated to serve as a groundwork and touchstone for several stakeholders at different levels.},

  abstract = {As smart home networks become increasingly complex and dynamic, maintaining trust between the various devices and services is crucial. Existing trust management approaches face challenges such as high computational overhead and difficulty in selecting optimal parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a new method for trust management in smart home networks based on swarm optimization, a principle of swarm intelligence. Our proposed approach is based on swarm optimization, which is a principle of swarm intelligence that optimizes communication patterns and manages trust values within the network. In SwarmTrust, the nodes in the smart home network are represented by particles, and the positions and velocities of these particles are adjusted to optimize communication patterns and reduce the computational burden on nodes. This optimization is achieved by evaluating the trust values of each node and adjusting the communication patterns accordingly. The proposed method integrates trust management with several distinct parameters and selects the parameters optimally to maintain efficiency. The proposed approach also addresses optimization challenges by monitoring communication patterns and managing trust values in a distributed manner, which reduces the computational burden on nodes and maintains efficiency. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted simulation experiments and compared the performance of our approach with existing methods. Our results showed notable improvements in terms of computational efficiency and optimized computation.},

  abstract = {In developing production sectors, the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) is a significant interchange between the internet of things (IoT) and vehicle automation systems in smart cities. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) uses the roadside unit (RSU) and nearby techniques to conduct different vehicle requirements. Since the number of vehicles and traffic delivery is growing asymmetrically, the service provider should implement innovative download strategies to increase efficiency and provide customers with high-quality service. Nevertheless, the lack of national knowledge and time-various IOVs make it extremely difficult for the roadside unit long-term energy restrictions to take successful offloading or discharging. Hence in this paper, the Optimized energy-efficient sensible edge processing (OEE-SEP) model for IoV in smart cities has been proposed for vehicle activity discharging with the estimated amount of time with less energy consumption. The sensible edge processing model comprises undirected activity discharging and similar activity discharging protocol, concerning the number of duties per unit time and the estimated time of completion for the same amount of information imported. An optimized energy-efficient model is formulated to reduce the total transmission delay and reduce the energy consumed during discharge. OEE-SEP leads to less energy consumption during activity discharging when the IoV processes and information loading activities are considered. The experimental results show that the suggested model enhances the performance rate of 97.45% with less transmission delay, less energy consumption for vehicle automation systems in smart cities.},

It can help manage the whole network environment in a consistent and holistic way, without the need of understanding the underlying network structure. At present, SDN may face many challenges like insider attacks, i.e., the centralized control plane would be attacked by malicious underlying devices and switches. To protect the security of SDN, effective detection approaches are indispensable. In the literature, challenge-based Collaborative Intrusion Detection Networks (CIDNs) are an effective detection framework in identifying malicious nodes. It calculates the nodes’ reputation and detects a malicious node by sending out a special message called a challenge. In this work, we devise a challenge-based CIDN in SDN and measure its performance against malicious internal nodes. Our results demonstrate that such a mechanism can be effective in SDN environments.},

  abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are on the way to be deployed around the world. The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.},

With the increasing demands of user applications, the number of connections is also increasing exponentially. Therefore, security becomes a critical issue in IoTs. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) services are important for IoT applications. IoTs must also ensure proper authentication mechanisms to ensure CIA in the second stage. Various researches in this direction address the authentication issues in IoTs. In this paper, we survey the authentication aspects in IoTs and their allied domains. We analyze the potentialities of the existing state-of-the art-approaches and also identify their limitations. We discuss the basics of authentication and its related attacks for the ease of interpretability of the readers. We show a taxonomical understanding of the approaches and try to connect the evolution of the solution strategies. These connections, to the best of our knowledge, are novel as compared to the existing authentication surveys. Besides, the multidimensional vision of this survey for IoT extensions is an add-on to the benefits. We also provide a discussion on the future direction of research in this domain. In a nutshell, this survey is a one-stop solution for academia and industry to understand the status quo of IoT authentication schemes/protocols.},

  abstract = {IoT infrastructures have been growing in recent years across a variety of industrial applications in sustainable smart cities and communities, including smart manufacturing and smart industries. Infrastructure geared towards Internet of Things also includes Cyber-Physical System (CPS). With a distributed environment, CPS has experienced significant success in industrial applications and critical infrastructure. However, there are numerous difficulties in such an environment, including those related to scalability, centralization, communication latency, and security and privacy. Deep residual squeeze and excitation network (DRSEN) with Single Candidate Optimizer-based IoT-oriented infrastructure is used in this manuscript to address these challenges. Blockchain creates a distributed environment for CPS's communication phase, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) establishes protocols for data forwarding in network. At the application layer of suggested infrastructure, a deep learning-based cloud is used to address communication latency, centralization, and scalability issues. It makes high-performance, affordable computing resources available for smart city applications like smart industrial and smart transportation. The proposed method is implemented in ns-3 tool and the effectiveness is assessed using F-measure, reliability, scalability, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The proposed method provides 35.39%, 23.87% and 20.67% higher reliability, 42.39%, 11.39%, 34.16% and 25.78% higher accuracy, 15.02%, 26.64% and 37.55% higher F-measure compared with existing techniques like Industrial Internet of Things based on Blockchain Secure Device Authentication Solution (IIoT-BC-BASA), Industrial Internet of things based on Blockchain- InterPlanetary File System (IIoT-BC-IPFS), Industrial Internet of Things based on Blockchain- Shamir Threshold Cryptography (IIoT-BC-SHC), Industrial Internet of Things based on Blockchain- software Define Networking (IIoT-BC-SDN) methods, respectively.},

  abstract = {Fog computing is a qualifiedly roseate technology introduced to support latency-sensitive and mission-critical applications by bringing resources closer to the end users. To exploit the full potentials of this auspicious technology, it is important to select optimal fog nodes for secured service provisioning. Therefore, in this work, an optimal fog node selection is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. To solve this problem, an efficient selection strategy based on improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) and modified firefly algorithm (FA) is developed. This study considers two important objectives that have not been optimized in the previous works: trust and rate of sojourn, in addition to remaining node capacity and energy consumption. The linear weighted-sum approach is used to aggregate the individual objective functions, after which the Best–worst method (BWM) is used to determine the weight vector of the aggregated function. The impact of the variation in the weight values of the most sensitive objective indicate that in the worst-case scenario, the proposed model is robust and insensitive with an improvement of about 42.16%–50.02% over the related methods. Moreover, we conduct an experimental simulation of the proposed selection strategy as well as comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art algorithms using six performance metrics. The results show that the proposed hybrid PSO-FA achieves a higher accuracy and faster convergence. The proposed solution also records an improvement of about 18.64%–69.45% in resource utilization, 10.94%–40.45% in energy consumption, 12.50%–75% in trust violation, 4.94%–31.12% in computation delay, and 24.71%–37.7% in makespan over the related advanced algorithms.},

The data is being inundated proactively from several sources in various forms; especially social media and in modern data science vocabulary is being recognized as Big Data. Today, Big Data is permeating through the bigger aspect of human life for scientific and commercial dependencies, especially for massive scale data analytics of beyond the exabyte magnitude. As the footprint of Big Data applications is continuously expanding, the reliability on cloud environments is also increasing to obtain appropriate, robust and affordable services to deal with Big Data challenges. Cloud computing avoids any need to locally maintain the overly scaled computing infrastructure that include not only dedicated space, but the expensive hardware and software also. Several data models to process Big Data are already developed and a number of such models are still emerging, potentially relying on heterogeneous underlying storage technologies, including cloud computing. In this paper, we investigate the growing role of cloud computing in Big Data ecosystem. Also, we propose a novel XCLOUDX {XCloudX, X…X}classification to zoom in to gauge the intuitiveness of the scientific name of the cloud-assisted NoSQL Big Data models and analyze whether XCloudX always uses cloud computing underneath or vice versa. XCloudX symbolizes those NoSQL Big Data models that embody the term “cloud” in their name, where X is any alphanumeric variable. The discussion is strengthen by a set of important case studies. Furthermore, we study the emergence of as-a-Service era, motivated by cloud computing drive and explore the new members beyond traditional cloud computing stack, developed in the past couple of years.},

As a consequence, the nature of the services that can be run on them changes too (smaller codebases, more fragmented state, etc.). These changes bring new requirements for service orchestrators, which need to evolve so as to support new scenarios where a close interaction between service and infrastructure becomes essential to deliver a seamless user experience.
