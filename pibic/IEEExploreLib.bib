In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for monitoring network traffic and detecting abnormal activities. This IDS framework integrates streaming engines for big data analytics, management and visualization. A Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) topology of multiple connected nodes with mobility capability is simulated in the Mininet-Wifi environment. Real-time data is collected using the sFlow technology and transmitted from the simulator to our proposed IDS framework. We have achieved high detection accuracy results by training the Random Forest as the classifier to label out the anomalous flows. Additionally, the network throughput has been evaluated and compared with and without deploying the proposed IDS. The results verify the system is a lightweight solution by bringing little burden to the network.},

  abstract   = {The dynamic nature of the vehicular space exposes it to distributed malicious attacks irrespective of the integration of enabling technologies. The software-defined network (SDN) represents one of these enabling technologies, providing an integrated improvement over the traditional vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). Due to the centralized characteristics of SDN, they are vulnerable to attacks that may result in life-threatening situations. Securing SDN-based VANETs is vital and requires incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Hence, this work proposed an intrusion detection model (IDM) to identify Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in the vehicular space. The proposed solution employs the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and an exhaustive parameter search technique called grid search cross-validation (GSCV). In this framework, the proposed architecture can be deployed on the onboard units (OBUs) of each vehicle, which receive the vehicular data and run intrusion detection tasks to classify a message sequence as a DDoS attack or benign. The performance of the proposed algorithm compared to other ML algorithms using key performance metrics. The proposed framework is validated through experimental simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting DDoS intrusion. Using the GridSearchCV, optimal values of the RBF-SVM kernel parameters “C” and “gamma”  $(\gamma)$  of 100 and 0.1, respectively, gave the optimal performance. The proposed scheme showed an overall accuracy of 99.33%, a detection rate of 99.22%, and an average squared error of 0.007, outperforming existing benchmarks.},

Then, the attacker takes charge of the whole network via launching a spoof controller and can also modify the flow tables. Hence, faster, and accurate detection of DDoS attacks against the controller will make the SDN reliable and secure. Moreover, the Internet traffic is drastically increasing due to unprecedented growth of connected devices. Consequently, the processing of large number of requests cause a performance bottleneck regarding SDN controller. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical control plane SDN architecture for multi-domain communication that uses a statistical method called principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the big data traffic and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is employed to detect a DDoS attack. SVM has high accuracy and less false positive rate while the PCA filters attribute drastically. Consequently, the performance of classification and accuracy is improved while the false positive rate is reduced.},

To address these challenges, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques have emerged as promising solutions for the detection of attacks and misbehavior in VANETs. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of ML and DL approaches for misbehavior detection in the context of VANETs using realistic simulation. We employ a synthetic generated dataset that includes a wide range of attacks commonly encountered in VANETs. To simulate realistic scenarios, we utilize a popular widely used and validated network simulator (i.e., Omnet++) with different open source projects to generate VANET-specific traffic patterns and communication dynamics. An useful overview of the whole process from data generation, passing by pre-processing and model training to performance evaluation is provided with an open source guithub repository. Our evaluation encompasses different ML and DL algorithms, including support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). We assess the performance of these approaches by measuring key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

With the development of software-defined networking (SDN) and multiaccess edge computing (MEC), a variety of resource allocation strategies in MEC-enabled software-defined networking-based VANET (SDVN) have been proposed to solve these problems. However, we note that few of these work involves the situation where SDVN is under Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Actually, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are extremely easy to be compromised by malicious users, and compromised IoT devices may be used to launch edge DDoS attacks against the MEC servers in MEC-enabled SDVN at any time. In this article, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based collaborative deep reinforcement learning (GCDRL) model to generate the resource provisioning and mitigating strategy. The model evaluates the trust value of the vehicles, formulates mitigation of edge DDoS attacks and resource provisioning strategies to ensure that the MEC servers can work normally under edge DDoS attacks. In addition, GNN is adopted in the DRL model to extract the structure feature of the graph composed of MEC servers, and help transfer computing tasks between MEC servers to alleviate the problem of resources imbalance between them. Experimental results show that the method of estimating the vehicular trust value is effective, and our method can make the average throughput of edge nodes more stable and lower down the average delay and the average energy consumption under the edge DDoS attack. Also, a real-world case study is conducted to verify our conclusion.},

The CPS framework is quite complicated because it requires a lot of different components to finish its various jobs.

According to a study, social animals are now more worried about their safety due to the rise in CPSs assaults. To identify attacks against CPSs, access control techniques and cryptography are specifically used.

One great threat to VANETs is Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack because the target of this attack is to prevent authorized nodes from accessing the services. To provide high availability of VANETs, a scalable, reliable and robust network intrusion detection system should be developed to efficiently mitigate DDoS. However, big data from VANETs poses serious challenges to DDoS attack detection since the detection system require scalable methods to capture, store and process the big data. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a distributed DDoS network intrusion detection system based on big data technology. The proposed detection system consists of two main components: real-time network traffic collection module and network traffic detection module. To build our proposed system, we use Spark to speed up data processing and use HDFS to store massive suspicious attacks. In the network collection module, micro-batch data processing model is used to improve the real-time performance of traffic feature collection. In the traffic detection module, the classification algorithm based on Random Forest (RF) is adopted. In order to evaluate the accuracy of detection, the algorithm was evaluated and compared in the datasets, containing NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. The experimental results show that the proposed detection algorithm reached the accuracy rate of 99.95% and 98.75%, and the false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.05% and 1.08%, respectively, in two datasets.},

The ML-based solutions use DDoS dynamics like adaptive traffic, heterogeneity, and packet features etc. As a result, a question arises whether these ML-based techniques are capable of handling novel security threats. In this paper, we use BayesNet technique on different datasets to test its performance and analyse the results to validate its usage for protecting against novel network security threats.

The CIC-DDoS-2019 dataset has 12 subsets and we use SYN, UDPLag and Portmap data subset. These datasets contain three types of DDoS attacks, i.e., SYN-flood attack, UDPLag attack, and Portmap attack. We test BayesNet to see the performance of the algorithm in detecting the mentioned forms of DDoS. We consider the parameters of accuracy, True Positive Rate (TPR), and False Positive Rate (FPR) for performance evaluation. In all the results, we observe that accuracy is always higher than 90%. TPR is very high, i.e. weighted TPR is 0.99 and wighted FPR of all tests is 0.076 that is quiet low.

In the paper, SDN based blockchain algorithm is applied, which coordinates network traffic and improves the overall security of the network.

Many researchers are now interested in adding a high level of security to VANETs. Machine learning (ML) methods were used for constructing a high level of security capabilities based on intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Furthermore, the vast majority of existing research is based on NSL-KDD or KDD-CUP99 datasets. Recent attacks are not present in these datasets. As a result, we employed a realistic dataset called ToN-IoT that derived from a large-scale, heterogeneous IoT network. This work tested various ML methods in both binary and multi-class classification problems. We used the Chi-square (Chi2) technique was used for feature selection and the Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) for class balancing. According to the results, the XGBoost method outperformed other ML methods.},

In this paper, we investigated machine learning (ML) enabled anomaly detection models for the IoT with regard to multi-objective optimization (Pareto optimization) that minimizes the detection error, execution time, and memory consumption simultaneously. Making use of well-known datasets consisting of network traffic traces captured in an IoT environment, we studied a variety of machine learning algorithms through the world-class H2O AI platform. Our experimental results show that the Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest, and Deep Learning models are the most accurate and fastest anomaly detection models; the Gradient Boosting Machine and Random Forest are the most accurate and memory-efficient models.

Hence, VANETs are one of the most insecure networks and are prone to various attacks like Masquerading, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) etc. Various algorithms have been proposed to safeguard VANETs against these attacks, which vary concerning security and QoS performance.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most popular attack types aiming at the availability of system. We consider the timely detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks to RSU in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). A novel framework for detecting and mitigating low-rate DDoS attacks in ITS based on nonparametric statistical anomaly detection is proposed. Dealing with low-rate DDoS attacks is challenging since they can bypass traditional data filtering techniques while threatening the RSU availability due to their highly distributed nature. Extensive simulation results are presented for a real road scenario with the help of the SUMO traffic simulation software. The results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms two parametric methods for timely detection based on the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) test, as well as the traditional data filtering approach in terms of average detection delay and false alarm rate.},

  abstract   = {While the emerging 6G networks are anticipated to meet the high-end service quality demands of the mobile edge users in terms of data rate and delay satisfaction, new attack surfaces and zero-day attacks continue to pose significant threats to their successful realization and rollouts. Traditionally, most service provisioning techniques considered security metrics separately from the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Expectation (QoE) parameters. The QoS/QoE parameters include data throughput, experienced delay, tolerable latency, jitter, resource utilization rate, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, fairness, and other emerging key performance indicators (KPIs). Also, there are various security attributes, such as encryption key strength, authentication strength, network anomaly score, privacy metric, and so on. Typically, the resource allocation optimization techniques to maximize the security aspects to protect the communication of mobile users or user equipment (UEs) have an adverse effect on the service quality. Therefore, a key research gap exists in balancing service quality and security levels in communication networks that has been either overlooked or identified in a rather scattered manner by researchers in the recent decade. Thus, a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art to clearly address this research gap and outline the possible solutions is yet to appear in the existing literature. In this paper, we address this by surveying the existing practices, challenges, and opportunities in the emerging 6G (i.e., beyond 5G) networks, where various AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based techniques such as deep learning meet the classical optimization techniques, to balance the service performance and security levels. Several networking topologies with relevant use-cases are included in the survey to discuss the existing and emerging trends of isolated as well as joint treatment of service and security levels. Lessons learned from each use-case are provided to demonstrate a clear road map for the interested readers and researchers in emerging networks to construct a natively combined service and security ecosystem, specifically in the network edge.},

The VANET-connected vehicle can send and receive data such as requests for emergency assistance, current traffic conditions, etc. VANET assistance with a vehicle for communication purposes is desperately needed. The routing method has the characteristics of safe routing to repair the trust-based features on a specific node.When malicious activity is uncovered, intrusion detection systems (IDS) are crucial tools for mitigating the damage. Collaborations between vehicles in a VANET enhance detection precision by spreading information about interactions across their nodes. This makes the machine learning distribution system feasible, scalable, and usable for creating VANET-based cooperative detection techniques. Privacy considerations are a major impediment to collaborative learning due to the data flow between nodes. A malicious node can get private details about other nodes by observing them. This study proposes a cooperative IDS for VANETs that safeguards the data generated by machine learning. In the intrusion detection phase, the selected optimal characteristics is used to detect network intrusion via a hybrid Deep Neural Network and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory approach. The Trust-based routing protocol then performs the intrusion prevention process, stopping the hostile node by having it select the most efficient routing path possible.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents the algorithm for the detection of jamming attack of Denial of Service (DoS) security attacks in VANETs. Since VANETs disseminate life saving information, so all the security attacks need to be detected well in time. DoS attack is one such attack which hinders the availability of the network for the legitimate users. They are not capable for sending critical information well in time to the vehicles in the network. The problem of DoS attack was solved using packet detection algorithms. In the existing packet detection algorithms, single malicious nodes were detected and that node was isolated from the routing network. But in the proposed packet detection algorithm, multiple malicious nodes and irrelevant nodes were detected and all the nodes are isolated from the routing network. All the routing between source and destination was done using Road Side Unit (RSU). The various parameters used for comparison are network throughput, packet delivery ratio, packet loss ratio, false positive rate and end to end delay. The values of these parameters in comparison with the existing algorithms prove the effectiveness of this algorithm.},

Software-defined networking (SDN) technology breaks the tight coupling between the control plane and the data plane in the traditional network architecture, making the controllability, security, and economy of network resources into a reality. As one of the important actualization methods of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), combined with SDN architecture will have great potential in areas, such as network resource management, route planning, traffic scheduling, fault diagnosis, and network security. This paper presents the network applications combined with SDN concepts based on ML from two perspectives, namely the perspective of ML algorithms and SDN network applications. From the perspective of ML algorithms, this paper focuses on the applications of classical ML algorithms in SDN-based networks, after a characteristic analysis of algorithms. From the other perspective, after classifying the existing network applications based on the SDN architecture, the related ML solutions are introduced. Finally, the future development of the ML algorithms and SDN concepts is discussed and analyzed. This paper occupies the intersection of the AI, big data, computer networking, and other disciplines; the AI itself is a new and complex interdisciplinary field, which causes the researchers in this field to often have different professional backgrounds and, sometimes, divergent research purposes. This paper is necessary and helpful for researchers from different fields to accurately master the key issues.},

There are several security mechanisms like Intrusion Detection System, Anomaly detection and Trust model by which we can be able to identify and counter the abuse of computer resources by unauthorized users. This paper presents a survey of several security mechanisms which have been implemented using Fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is one of the rapidly developing technologies, which is used in a sophisticated control system. Fuzzy logic deals with the degree of truth rather than the Boolean logic, which carries the values of either true or false.

Blockchain can be used to cryptographically store all the data that is sent to/from the drones, thereby saving it from tampering and eavesdropping. Various ML algorithms can be used to detect malicious drones in the network and to detect safe routes.

  abstract   = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) exchange real-time and seamless data between other AVs and the network, thus revolutionizing the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Automated transportation brings numerous benefits to human beings. However, the concerns such as safety, security, and privacy keep rising. In navigation and trajectory planning, the AVs require exchanging sensory information from their own and other AVs. In such cases, when a malicious AV or faulty sensor-equipped AV comes into connectivity, it can have disruptive consequences. This paper proposes a Hybrid Deep Anomaly Detection (HDAD) approach for effective anomaly detection and cyber-attack mitigation in AVs. The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm in HDAD approach acts over the 6G network to combat new-age cyber-attacks and provide a swift and accurate anomaly detection mechanism. In conjunction with Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntIRL), the HDAD approach identifies and isolates malicious AVs. It is envisioned that the obtained results prove the effectiveness of HDAD and have an 8.2% higher accuracy rate than the existing systems.},

CPS sends messages to physical devices to carry out computational operations. CPS mainly deals with the interplay among cyber and physical environments. The real-time network data acquired and collected in physical space is stored there, and the connection becomes sophisticated. CPS incorporates cyber and physical technologies at all phases. Cyber Physical Systems are a crucial component of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The CPS is a traditional concept that brings together the physical and digital worlds inhabit. Nevertheless, CPS has several difficulties that are likely to jeopardise our lives immediately, while the CPS's numerous levels are all tied to an immediate threat, therefore necessitating a look at CPS security. Due to the inclusion of IoT devices in a wide variety of applications, the security and privacy of users are key considerations. The rising level of cyber threats has left current security and privacy procedures insufficient. As a result, hackers can treat every person on the Internet as a product. Deep Learning (DL) methods are therefore utilised to provide accurate outputs from big complex databases where the outputs generated can be used to forecast and discover vulnerabilities in IoT systems that handles medical data. Cyber-physical systems need anomaly detection to be secure. However, the rising sophistication of CPSs and more complex attacks means that typical anomaly detection approaches are unsuitable for addressing these difficulties since they are simply overwhelmed by the volume of data and the necessity for domain-specific knowledge. The various attacks like DoS, DDoS need to be avoided that impact the network performance. In this paper, an effective Network Cluster Reliability Model with enhanced security and privacy levels for the data in IoT for Anomaly Detection (NSRM-AD) using deep learning model is proposed.

The main applications of IoVs are traffic management, emergency messages delivery, E-health, traffic, and temperature monitoring. On the other hand, IoVs lack in location awareness and geographic distribution, which is critical for some IoVs applications such as smart traffic lights and information sharing in vehicles. To support these topographies, fog computing was proposed as an appealing and novel term, which was integrated with IoVs to extend storage, computation, and networking. Unfortunately, it is also challenged with various security and privacy hazards, which is a serious concern of smart cities. Therefore, we can formulate that Fog-assisted IoVs (Fa-IoVs), are challenged by security threats during information dissemination among mobile nodes. These security threats of Fa-IoVs are considered as anomalies which is a serious concern that needs to be addressed for smooth Fa-IoVs network communication. Here, smooth communication refers to less risk of important data loss, delay, communication overhead, etc. This research work aims to identify research gaps in the Fa-IoVs network and present a deep learning-based dynamic scheme named CAaDet (Convolutional autoencoder Aided anomaly detection) to detect anomalies. CAaDet exploits convolutional layers with a customized autoencoder for useful feature extraction and anomaly detection. Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is done by using the F1-score metric where experiments are carried out by exploiting a benchmark dataset named NSL-KDD. CAaDet also observes the behavior of fog nodes and hidden neurons and selects the best match to reduce false alarms and improve F1-score. The proposed scheme achieved significant improvement over existing schemes for anomaly detection. Identified research gaps in Fa-IoVs can give future directions to researchers and attract more attention to this new era.},

Motivated by this issue, we propose an optimized traffic measurement method based on reinforcement learning in this paper, which can collect most of the network traffic data by activating NetFlow on a subset of interfaces of routers in a network.

Intrusions are a severe security threat that exploits the inherent vulnerabilities of NC. In order to make NC-enabled mobile small cells to realize their full potential, it is essential to implement intrusion detection systems. When compared to homomorphic signature or hashing systems, homomorphic message authentication codes (MACs) provide safe network coding techniques with relatively smaller overheads. A number of research studies have been conducted with the goal of developing mobile small cells that are enabled with secure network coding and coming up with integrity protocols that are appropriate for such crowded situations. However, the intermediate nodes alter packets while they are in transit and hence the integrity of the data cannot be confirmed by using MACs and checksums. This research study has analyzed numerous intrusion detection models for NC enabled small cells. This research helps the scholars to get a brief idea about various intrusion detection models.},

In SP-CIDS, a Distributed Machine Learning (DML) model based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is used, which leverages the potential of vehicle-to-vehicle collaboration in the learning process to improve the storage efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of the IDS. However, there are significant data privacy concerns possible in such collaboration, where a CIDS can act as a malicious system that has access to the intermediate stages of the learning process. Additionally, the SP-CIDS system uses Differential Privacy (DP) technique to address the aforementioned data privacy risk associated with the DML-based CIDS. The SP-CIDS system is evaluated with logistic regression, naïve bayes, and ensemble classifiers. Simulation results substantiate that a private ensemble classifier secures the training data with DP and also achieves 96.94% accuracy.},

A misbehavior detection systems (MDS) is a tool developed to detect if a vehicular network is being attacked so that the system can take steps to mitigate harm from the attacker. Vehicular communication systems face significant risks from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. During a DDoS attack, multiple nodes are used to flood the target with an overwhelming amount of communication packets. In this paper, we first survey the current MDS literature and how it is used to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. We then propose a new distributed multilayer perceptron classifier (MLPC) for DDoS detection and evaluate the performance of the proposed detection scheme in vehicular communication systems. For the evaluations using simulations, two specific implementations of the attacks are conducted. Apache Spark is then used to create the distributed MLPC.

The proposed method outperformed linear regression and support vector machines, which achieved 89% and 88% respectively, but is unable to perform better than random forests and gradient boosted trees which both achieved a 97% F1-score. Using Amazon Web Services (AWS), it is determined that model training and detection time are not significantly increased with the inclusion of additional nodes after three nodes including the master.},

  abstract   = {Vehicular communication has emerged as a powerful tool for providing a safe and comfortable driving experience for users. Long Term Evolution (LTE) supports and enhances the quality of vehicular communication due to its properties such as high data rate, spatial reuse, and low delay. However, high mobility of vehicles introduces a wide variety of security threats, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose effective solutions for real-time detection and localization of DoS attacks in an LTE-based vehicular network with mobile network components (e.g., vehicles, femto access points, etc.). We consider malicious data transmission by vehicles in two ways- using real identification (unintentional) and using fake identification (intentional). This paper makes three important contributions. First, we propose an efficient attack detection technique based on data packet counter and average Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). Next, we present an improved attack detection framework using machine learning algorithms. We use some ML-based supervised classification algorithms to make detection more robust and consistent. Finally, we propose Data Packet Counter (DPC)-based, triangulation-based and measurement report based localization for both intentional and unintentional DoS attacks. We analyze the average packet delay incurred by vehicles by modelling the system as an $M/M/m$ queue. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed technique significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract  = {Recent advances of vehicular networking technolo-gies are giving birth to the emerging class of road safety and collaborative driving applications, where cars need to commu-nicate and assist each other with various tasks, such as sharing views from onboard cameras, performing distributed predictions of car positions, etc. The proposed Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture promises a straightforward way to implement such applications with enhanced data delivery and security capabilities. However, one of the critical elements of vehicular applications is the need of reliable trust: the communicating cars must ensure that parties will do the job they are asked to do. Such trust, while can be mechanically implemented through the use of cryptographic signatures, requires the establishment of trust relations between the cars. This is especially a challenge, given the individual cars in a typical urban environment can very infrequently meet each other and each encounter could be very short-term. Although one can rely on a manufacturer-centric endorsement of car actions (e.g., by installing manufacturer certificates as global trust anchors, creating manufacturer-signed certs for individual cars, and trusting data that is signed by such certificates), it is not sufficient for the collaborative applications. Such certificate can only tell that data is coming from the specific car model, but does not guarantee the quality of the data/actions. This paper considers ideas and concepts developed based on the Swift Trust model and explores their use in vehicular environments with NDN-based communication. With Swift Trust, vehicles in the communication range can quickly make short-term trust decisions for secure publishing, consumption, and processing of data (e.g., to cooperatively analyze the nearby environment for potential safety issues). As an initial step, the paper explores a task-oriented method of establishing trust based on request-response communication. The paper also highlights several potential threats and attacks and discusses possible directions to mitigate them.},

The Road Side Units (RSUs) within the range receives the beacon and replies back with information about the congestion in the future path. Based on that information, the vehicle can change / update the path to its destination. We have performed the simulations with help of two tools, SUMO for generating the traffic and creating the maps and OMNET ++ for simulating the network.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an important tool for detecting network attacks and is an effective means of improving network security. However, existing IDSs encounter several problems involving inaccurate detections, low detection efficiencies, and incomplete detections owing to extensive changes in vehicle locations in VANETs. This study explores federated learning in software-defined VANETs and designs an efficient and accurate collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) model. The model utilizes the collaboration among local software-defined networks (SDNs) to jointly train the CIDS model without directly exchanging local network data flows to improve the expansibility and globality of IDSs. To reduce the model difference between different SDN clients and improve the detection accuracy, this study regards the prediction loss for each SDN client as an objective from the perspective of constrained multi-objective optimization. By optimizing a surrogate maximum function containing all the objectives, the method adopts two-stage gradient optimization to achieve Pareto optimality for SDN clients with the worst fairness constraint maximization performance. In addition, this study evaluates the training model using two open-source datasets and compares it with the latest methods. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model ensures local data privacy and demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency in detecting attacks and is thus superior to the current schemes.},

Meanwhile, these low-power devices typically cannot support complex security mechanisms and, thus, are highly susceptible to malware. This article proposes ADRIoT, an anomaly detection framework for IoT networks, which leverages edge computing to uncover potential threats. An edge is empowered with an anomaly detection module, which consists of a traffic capturer, a traffic preprocessor, and a collection of anomaly detectors dedicated to each type of device. Each detector is constructed by an LSTM autoencoder in an unsupervised manner that requires no labeled attack data and is able to handle emerging zero-day attacks. When a device connects to the edge, the edge will fetch the corresponding detector from the cloud and execute it locally. Another problem is the resource constraint of a single edge device like a home router hinders the deployment of such a detection module. To mitigate this problem, we design a multiedge collaborative mechanism that integrates the resource of multiple edges in a local network to increase the overall load capacity. The evaluation demonstrates that ADRIoT can detect various IoT-based attacks effectively and efficiently, showing that ADRIoT can feasibly help build a more secure IoT environment.},

Such reliance on IoT is resulting in a significant amount of data to be generated, collected, processed, and analyzed. The big data analytics is no doubt beneficial for business development. However, at the same time, numerous threats to the availability and privacy of the user data, message, and device integrity, the vulnerability of IoT devices to malware attacks and the risk of physical compromise of devices pose a significant danger to the sustenance of IoT. This paper thus endeavors to highlight most of the known threats at various layers of the IoT architecture with a focus on the anatomy of malware attacks. We present a detailed attack methodology adopted by some of the most successful malware attacks on IoT, including ICS and CPS. We also deduce an attack strategy of a distributed denial of service attack through IoT botnet followed by requisite security measures.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play an important role to protect the vehicular network by detecting misbehaving vehicles. In general, the works in the literature use the same well-known features in a centralized IDS. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) mechanism that takes advantage of three new features, which are mainly related to the sender position, allowing to enhance the performances of IDS for position falsification attacks. Besides, it presents a comparison of two different ML methods for classification, i.e. k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Random Forest (RF) that are used to detect malicious vehicles using these features. Finally, Ensemble Learning (EL) which combines different ML methods, in our case kNN and RF, is also carried out to improve the detection performance. An IDS is constructed allowing vehicles to detect misbehavior in a distributed way, while the detection mechanism is trained centrally. The results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism gives better results, in terms of classification performance indicators and computational time, than the best previous approaches on average.},

However, the ubiquitous and wide-range IoT networks make them prone to cyberattacks. One of the main types of attack is a denial of service (DoS), where the attacker floods the network with a large volume of data to prevent nodes from using the services. An intrusion detection mechanism is considered a chief source of protection for information and communications technology. However, conventional intrusion detection methods need to be modified and improved for application to the IoT owing to certain limitations, such as resource-constrained devices, the limited memory and battery capacity of nodes, and specific protocol stacks. In this paper, we develop a lightweight attack detection strategy utilizing a supervised machine learning-based support vector machine (SVM) to detect an adversary attempting to inject unnecessary data into the IoT network. The simulation results show that the proposed SVM-based classifier, aided by a combination of two or three incomplex features, can perform satisfactorily in terms of classification accuracy and detection time.},

  abstract   = {Network traffic data has developed into an appealing target for attacks as new network communication services have drawn more attention. Due to the enormous number of data these systems create, conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) cannot detect intruder behaviors in large-scale network systems. To detect malicious assaults early on, an effective IDS must be able to scan massive volumes of network traffic data quickly. In order to identify various types of intrusion in network systems, this study introduces a unique distributed network IDS (NIDS). The suggested NIDS is built on a distributed random forest that can analyze huge amounts of data quickly. The two steps of the suggested method are the traffic gathering module and the attack detection module. In VANETs, the random forest method was employed for real-time DDoS attack detection. A variety of performance criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, were tested on the system to confirm the performance of the suggested framework. The proposed method achieves improved classification accuracy, according to the results. The suggested approach is suitable for complicated systems with high speed and low false alarm rates that require real-time intrusion detection.},

  abstract = {Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are prone to packet drop attacks because of their inherent distributed architecture and dynamic topology. Existing security schemes mainly focus on multi-path and trust-based routing. Unfortunately, the former causes high energy consumption and the latter requires trust assessment, which is not easy to implement in practice. Route mutation (RM) is emerging as an active defense technology that changes routes periodically. Traditional RM is conceived for fixed network topologies, and needs a centralized controller, so that it cannot be applied to VANETs. Therefore, the present contribution investigates RM in VANETs by proposing a Grid-based extended Joint Action Learning approach (Grid-eJAL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first contribution that designs an online and adaptive multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for RM to mitigate attacks in VANETs. Differently from existing MARL schemes, Grid-eJAL allows vehicles to share parameters to accelerate the convergence speed of learning. In Grid-eJAL, the area of interest is split in equally sized grids and, when a vehicle transmits packets, the next hop with the minimum angle of mobility is selected within the grid considered as optimal by the learning policy. The convergence of Grid-eJAL is proved theoretically. Finally, extensive simulation results highlight the effectiveness of Grid-eJAL compared to representative state-of-the-art solutions.},

One challenge that the PKI infrastructure does not eliminate is the possibility of malicious vehicles mounting a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. We present a scheme that combines statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to detect and prevent blackhole attacks in a VANET environment.Simulation results demonstrate that on average, our model produces an Area Under The Curve (ROC) and Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUC) score of 96.78% which is much higher than a no skill ROC AUC score and only 3.22% away from an ideal ROC AUC score. Considering all the performance metrics, we show that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gradient Boosting classifier are more accurate and perform consistently better under various circumstances. Both have an accuracy of over 98%, F1-scores of over 95%, and ROC AUC scores of over 97%. Our scheme is robust and accurate as evidenced by its ability to identify and prevent blackhole attacks. Moreover, the scheme is scalable in that addition of vehicles to the network does not compromise its accuracy and robustness.},

In the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain can be used to create a decentralized, reliable, and secure environment.

As a result, the future roadmap is hazy, and several challenges and questions must be addressed. Several articles combining blockchain technology with IoT have recently been released, but they are limited to shallow technological potential discussions, with very few providing an in- depth examination of the complexities of implementing blockchain technology for IoT. Therefore, this paper aims to coherently and comprehensively provide current cutting-edge efforts in this direction. It provides a literature review of IoT and blockchain integration by examining current research issues and trends in the applications of blockchain-related approaches and technologies within the IoT security context.

The surveyed articles have been chronologically organized in tables for better clarity. In this paper, we try to investigate the vital issues and challenges to the integration of IoT and blockchain, and then investigate the research efforts that have been conducted so far to overcome these challenges.},

This paper identifies the design principles and open research issues in the twin fields of self-organization and resilience for networked systems. In combination, they offer the prospect of combating threats and allowing essential services that run on networked systems to continue operating satisfactorily. This will be achieved, on the one hand, through the (self-)adaptation of networked systems and, on the other hand, through structural and operational resilience techniques to ensure that they can detect, defend against, and ultimately withstand challenges.},

In fact, compared to other layers, the physical layer between the base stations and users' device presents increased opportunities for attacks such as eavesdropping and data fabrication. However, no single OSI layer can stand on its own to provide proper security. All layers in the 5G must work together, providing their own unique technology in an effort to ensure security and integrity for 5G data.},

In this article, we present a thorough analysis of autonomous driving security. First, the attack surface of autonomous driving is presented. After an analysis of the operation of autonomous driving in terms of key components and technologies, the security of autonomous driving is elaborated in four dimensions: 1) sensors; 2) operating system; 3) control system; and 4) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. Sensor security is examined from five components, which are mainly responsible for self-positioning and environmental perception. The analysis of operating system security, the second dimension, is concentrated on the robot operating system. Concerning the control system security, the controller area network is approached mainly from vulnerabilities and protection measures. The fourth dimension, V2X communication security, is probed from four categories of attacks: 1) authenticity/identification; 2) availability; 3) data integrity; and 4) confidentiality with corresponding solutions. Moreover, the drawbacks of existing methods adopted in the four dimensions are also provided. Finally, a conceptual multilayer defense framework is proposed to secure the information flow from external communication to the physical autonomous vehicle.},

The DTNs have been primarily developed for interplanetary networks (IPNs), however, it shows applicability to challenged networks. Thus, solutions devised for security and routing for traditional networks do not apply to DTNs due to its unique nature. Moreover, this paper shows less attention particularly in security and its related strings. In DTNs, malicious nodes launch various attacks that include packet drop, a fake packet, and flood attack. These attacks inevitably overuse scarce resources (bandwidth, buffer, and energy) in DTNs, which leads to low packet delivery ratio and high packet loss ratio. Flood attack is listed in top among the challenging attacks in DTNs. The existing techniques to confront flood attack suffered from high-detection time and low-detection accuracy. This paper proposed novel resources efficient (distributed and intrusion detection system-based) algorithms to mitigate flood attack. The simulation results show considerable improvement in detection time, detection accuracy, and resource consumption, and also show enhanced packet delivery ratio and reduced packet loss ratio.},

The VFC is vulnerable to a variety of attacks, and existing security measures in traditional networks are not necessarily applicable to VFC. Among these attacks, we can find the Sybil attack that allows a vehicle to create multiple identities to perform malicious operations. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based mechanism to detect Sybil attacks in VFC networks. The detection process consists of two levels; the first one is targeted toward the verification of the vehicle’s position by the FN using the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) technique. The FN delivers a position proof, if its position is valid, and stores it in the blockchain. At this point, the set of the obtained position proofs constitutes a trajectory. The second level is projected toward a comparison between the trajectories of the vehicles reporting an event. Two trajectories that pass through the same FNs at the same time, will be considered as Sybil trajectories. The objective of these two-level detections is to identify the Sybil attack in several attack scenarios performed by a powerful adversary. Our analysis shows that existing proposals cannot deal with such an adversary. Moreover, simulation results show the efficiency of our proposal in terms of communication, computation, and detection rate. Indeed, our system can reach a detection rate of 98% when the malicious vehicle generates several aliases simultaneously and sends position requests to the FN for each generated pseudonym.},

Such advancements come with ample benefits, such as the reduction of traffic accidents and the refinement of transit efficiency. However, these new developments were not necessarily made with security in mind. Researchers have unearthed a number of security vulnerabilities in paradigms such as in-vehicle networks (IVNs), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). As automotive technologies continue to evolve, it would be realistic to expect new vulnerabilities to arise—both vulnerabilities that are identified and vulnerabilities that are not. If—or more pragmatically, when—these vulnerabilities are exploited, intrusion detection will be paramount. Therefore, we find it prudent to review intrusion detection in the automotive domain. We explore a myriad of threats and intrusion detection techniques—from the boundaries of the vehicle’s own network to the wider Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Intrusion detection, while not a panacea, can be a cost-effective solution to many automotive security issues. Generally, such intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do not disrupt existing hardware, infrastructure, or communications; rather, they merely tap into the network and monitor for suspicious traffic. Given the very reasonable price tag, the implementation of intrusion detection systems would be an auspicious step by the automotive industry to assure the security—and safety—of the modern automobile. This paper volunteers a comprehensive review of intrusion detection technologies in the automotive domain.},

Insecure features in some wireless networks make the victims vulnerable to attacks so that any action can take time to implement. And another is that, as new techniques are evolving today, by making progress in the field of hacking, attackers will make every effort to infiltrate the system. Therefore, it is important to constantly monitor the system and detect suspicious behavior. So at such times, the intrusion detection system works to monitor the data, suspicious intrusions, and respond appropriately.

Traditionally, both cryptographic and non-cryptographic approaches have been used by researchers to address security and privacy issues and achieve secure Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. However, some security goals such as trust and reputation, are still hard to achieve through conventional cryptographic approaches. Trust is the degree of certainty with which the received information is accepted and acted upon. Historically trust has been computed for both the content generator and the content itself with former known as entity trust and the latter known as data trust. Both entity and content trust are equally important to support trustworthy communication in VANET. We review, analyze, and compare some of the recently proposed trust establishment and management mechanisms (from 2014 to 2019) in vehicular networks. Furthermore, we also discuss the weaknesses and inadequacies of existing trust establishment and management approaches when deployed in a VANET environment. Finally, we discuss some future challenges that will need to be addressed for trustworthy communications in vehicular networks.},

Built - in safety smart vehicular traffic infrastructure protects both passengers and drivers, but due to its dynamic nature, real-time implementation is difficult. They lay the groundwork for the creation of intelligent transportation systems (IPS) and frameworks, which allow road entities to communicate with one another and build new applications and services with the goal of improving both the driving experience and overall road safety. The demanding features of VANETs make it difficult to establish security measures, resulting in gaps that attackers could exploit.

The enhanced ML algorithms improves attack detection, protecting data inter-communications between various sources and destinations, and ensuring strong anonymity, authentication, and privacy. The proposed system trains and tests its machine learning algorithms on publicly available datasets of vehicle communications. As a result, the outcomes are repeatable and verifiable. The machine learning-based security system can detect attacks while maintaining low False Positive Rate values (FPR). The findings also suggest that the framework may benefit from employing a variety of algorithms present at various hierarchical levels, selecting algorithms with high performance and focus at the cost of preciseness in lower levels and additionally sophisticated, detailed, and accurate algorithms present in top levels.},

Moreover, it is vulnerable to a wide range of malicious attacks due to its nature. Such issues might cause a complete failure in VANET services and hence cause accidents, injuries, or death. Thus, VANET reliability and security are very critical. This paper discusses briefly different types of malicious attacks in VANET and some of their detection techniques. It gives more attention to position falsification attack as it has a severe impact on different VANET services. Furthermore, it explores previously proposed detection approaches for this attack using either traditional or machine learning techniques. Finally, attention will be drawn to unresolved challenges and potential future research directions.},

In this paper, we present a Deep Learning (DL) based end-to-end intrusion detection method to automatically detect malware traffic for OBUs. Different from previous intrusion detection methods, our proposed method only requires raw traffic instead of private information features extracted by the human. The performance is compared with previous methods on a public dataset and a simulated real-life VANET dataset. Experimental results show that our method can attain a higher performance with a lower resources requirement.},

This gives them the ability to contribute to safer roads and passenger comfort through network devices, cameras, sensors, and computational storage and processing capabilities. However, to run new and popular applications, and to enable vehicles operating autonomously requires massive computational resources. Computational resources available with the current day vehicles are not sufficient to process all these demands. In this situation, other vehicles, edge servers, and servers in remote data centers can help the vehicles by lending their computing resources. However, to take advantage of these computing resources, computation offloading techniques have to be leveraged to transfer tasks or entire applications to run on other devices. Such computation offloading can lead to improved performance and Quality of Service (QoS) for applications and for the network. However, computation offloading in a highly dynamic environment such as vehicular networks is a major challenge. Therefore, this survey aims to review and organize the computation offloading literature in vehicular environments. In addition, we demystify some concepts, propose a taxonomy with the most important aspects and classify most works in the area according to each category. We also present the main tools, scenarios, subjects, strategies, objectives, etc., used in the works.

Fog computing is an additional help to cloud infrastructure by utilizing a portion of the less-registered undertaking at the edge devices, reducing the end client’s reaction time, such as IoT. However, most of the IoT devices are resource-constrained, and there are many devices that cyber attacks could target. Cyber-attacks such as bottleneck, Dos, DDoS, and botnets are still significant threats in the IoT environment. Botnets are currently the most significant threat on the internet. A set of infected systems connected online and directed by an adversary to carry out malicious actions without authorization or authentication is known as a botnet. A botnet can compromise the system and steal the data. It can also perform attacks, like Phishing, spamming, and more. To overcome the critical issue, we exhibit a novel botnet attack detection approach that could be utilized in fog computing situations to dispense with the attack using the programmable nature of the software-defined network (SDN) environment. We carefully tested the most recent dataset for our proposed technique, standard and extended performance evaluation measures, and current DL models. To further illustrate overall performance, our findings are cross-validated. The proposed method performs better than previous ones in correctly identifying 99.98% of multi-variant sophisticated bot attacks. Additionally, the time of our suggested method is 0.022(ms), indicating good speed efficiency results.},

Although many trust schemes are proposed for addressing these issues, the reliance on only trust updates could increase the risk of long-term attacks before being detected. In this article, we design a human cognition-based trust update scheme (HC-TUS) for AI-VANET. Significantly, the novel trust update scheme is designed by strategically incorporating the Ebbinghaus forgetting theory. The simulation results indicate that 1) HC-TUS could better meet the principle of “Hard to get, easy to lose” for trust than BRSN and BTDS; 2) HC-TUS could detect and resist the collusion attack more quickly than BRSN and BTDS. The open issues in terms of trust for AI-VANET are also investigated and highlighted.},

However, these solutions are often provided by third-party organizations, which require entities to place trust in these providers, a risk that is unacceptable for industries such as the military and banking.

We have implemented, tested, and deployed our Blockchain-based access control architecture on the Avalanche official network. The results demonstrate that this solution offers strong security, flexibility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, making it a promising approach to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in the Internet of Things (IoT). Our deployment on the Avalanche network confirms the feasibility and robustness of our approach in a real-world setting.},

  abstract = {We are seeing a growth in the number of connected vehicles in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) to achieve the goal of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). This is leading to a connected vehicular network scenario with vehicles continuously broadcasting data to other vehicles on the road and the roadside network infrastructure. The presence of a large number of communicating vehicles greatly increases the number and types of possible anomalies in the network. Existing works provide solutions addressing specific anomalies in the network only. However, since there can be a multitude of anomalies possible in the network, there is a need for better anomaly detection frameworks that can address this unprecedented scenario. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework for VANETs based on deep neural networks (DNNs) using a sequence reconstruction and thresholding algorithm. In this framework, the DNN architectures are deployed on the roadside units (RSUs) which receive the broadcast vehicular data and run anomaly detection tasks to classify a particular message sequence as anomalous or genuine. Multiple DNN architectures are implemented in this experiment and their performance is compared using key evaluation metrics. Performance comparison of the proposed framework is also drawn against the prior work in this area. Our best performing deep learning-based scheme detects anomalous sequences with an accuracy of 98%, a great improvement over the set benchmark.},

Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is the part of ITS; that deals with the routing protocols and security of smart vehicles. However, due to the rapid increase in the number of smart vehicles, the existing network technology’s resources unable to handle the traffic load. It expects that the 6G communication system has the ability to fulfill the requirements of VANETs. Only a few studies explore this area, but they also overlooked the security aspect of VANETs in 6G communications networks. In this paper, we present an approach to address authentication and security issues for vehicles in VANET. By authenticating cars in the VANET and identifying various cyber assaults such as DDoS, our method significantly contributes to the intelligent transport communication network. Our approach uses the concepts of identity-based encryption to provide access control to the vehicles and deep learning-based techniques for filtering malicious packets. Our identity-based encryption technique is IND-sID-CCA secure, and a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm detects malicious packets with an accuracy of 99.72%. These results emphasize the validity of our proposed approach for VANETs in 6G communication systems.},

However, with the increasing technical requirements and daily demand in IoV, the drawbacks of traditional TCP/IP protocols, e.g., weak scalability in large networks, low efficiency in the dense environment and unreliable addressing in high mobility circumstance, become non-trivial especially in vehicular environments. Fortunately, the emerging Named Data Networking (NDN) technology provides a good choice to address the above issues in vehicular environments. Specifically, the introduced content store module in NDN which caches the sent/received contents, can greatly improve the networking performance by suppressing redundancy as well as enriching diversity. With aforementioned motivations, we thoroughly studied previous works on Vehicular Named Data Networking (VNDN) with emphasis on content caching, and then demonstrate the feasibility and necessity for employing NDN in vehicular environments with the help of content caching. Subsequently, we further strengthened the importance of cache selection and replacement strategies in VNDN framework, which is positioned to meet the challenges of data transmission efficiency and resource consumption by leveraging in-network vehicular caching. After that, we engaged in an in-depth survey on the existing cache selection and replacement schemes in VNDN, with their applicability compared. Next, further challenges during caching design were elaborately analyzed considering the specific characteristics of VNDN. Finally, we highlighted the potential research directions which may shine lights on the promising efforts to improve the performance of VNDN content caching.},

ICN is a clean-slate design for accommodating the ever increasing growth of the Internet traffic by regarding content as the network primitive, adopting in-network caching, and name-based routing, while SDN focuses on agile and flexible network management by decoupling network control logic from data forwarding. ICN and SDN have gained significant research attention separately in the most of the previous work. However, the features of ICN have profound impacts on the design and operation of SDN, such as in-network caching and data-centric security. Conversely, SDN provides a powerful tool for experimenting and deploying ICN architectures and can greatly facilitate ICN functionality and management. In this paper, we point out the necessity of surveying the scattered works on integrating SDN and ICN (SD-ICN) for improving operational networks. Specifically, we analyze the points of SD-ICN strengths and opportunities, and discuss the SDN enablers for deploying ICN architectures. In addition, we review and classify the recent work on improving the network management by SD-ICN and discuss the potential security benefits of SD-ICN.

The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer network that can be utilized on SDN-based Internet of Things (IoT) environments for security provisioning. Hence, to meet some challenges in digital forensics such as data integrity, evidence deletion or alteration, blockchain is used. However, some problems such as poor attack detection and slow processing existed in previous works. To address these issues, an efficient forensics architecture is proposed in SDN-IoT that establishes the Chain of Custody (CoC) in blockchain technology. The proposed SDN-based IoT architecture is initiated with flow table rules on switches for the three different traffics Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In this work, overloaded switches migrate the packets to nearby switches to balance the packet flow. The packets disobeying flow rules will be discarded by switches. The blockchain-based distributed controller in this forensic architecture is designed to use the Linear Homomorphic Signature (LHS) algorithm for validating users. Each controller is fed with a classifier that uses the Neuro Multi-fuzzy to classify malicious packets based on packet features. The logs of events are used and stored on the blockchain in the proposed SDN-IoT architecture. We evaluated the performance of our forensic architecture and compared it to the existing model using various performance measures. Our evaluation results demonstrate performance improvement by reducing delay, response time and processing time, increasing throughput, accuracy, and security parameters.},

Examples of such inhibitors include the bullwhip effect, new product lines, high inventory, and restrictive data flows.

Also, restrictive data flow in a complex global SC network generally slows down the movement of goods and services. The use of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in SC management (SCM) demonstrates the potentials to reduce these bottlenecks through transparency, decentralization, and optimizations in data management. These technologies promise to enhance the trustworthiness of entities within the SC, ensure the accuracy of data-driven operations, and enable existing SCM processes to migrate from a linear to a fully circular economy.

It acts as a roadmap for current and future researchers who focus on SC security management to better understand the integration of digital technologies such as DLT.

These systems mainly use sensors installed on the vehicle and help drivers deal with human operation errors. Traffic accidents are inherently unpredictable, and it is difficult to prevent mistakes made by others. Therefore, the concept of defensive driving has attracted much interest. Defensive driving aims to increase drivers' self-awareness to prevent accidents. Future self-driving vehicles should integrate defensive driving to improve driver safety. This paper proposes a framework based on the risk evaluation value of defensive driving that rapidly transmits information about high-accident-likelihood zones to drivers or vehicles by using Internet of Vehicles technology. This should enable drivers or self-driving vehicles to predict risks and operate vehicles safely. To send alert messages in a timely manner, it is essential to overcome the challenge of processing real-time data during driving. We design five kinds of services in this rapid response framework, including raw data receiver, warning area decision, accident pattern recognition, message generator, and user profile to analyze driver information using distributed system architecture. Message-oriented middleware is used for communication between services. This framework identifies high-accident-likelihood zones by using density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, simplifying the process of association calculation. After the calculation, this framework uses the weighted severity index to weight and compare risk severities. According to our experimental results, the service-oriented middleware design increases the speed and stability of information transmission.},

However, the attackers can exploit this communication by forging the controller area network (CAN) protocol and injecting malicious traffic. In this context, the vehicles mislead by false update messages and alerts. To overcome this issue, this paper presents the artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain-based proposed architecture on a 6G network. The proposed architecture is examined with a car hacking dataset, wherein the sensors of vehicles are communicating with each other for data sharing. For that, we have adopted an AI algorithm, i.e., random forest (RF), to classify normal and malicious data traffic. Further, edge nodes are considered to reduce the computation of AI algorithms and faster accessibility of vehicular data. Furthermore, incorporating inter planetary file system (IPFS) and a 6G network makes the proposed architecture cost-effective and scalable. Finally, the architecture is evaluated against performance metrics such as accuracy, latency, and scalability. The results demonstrate that the RF surpasses the other algorithms in terms of accuracy and achieves 97% accuracy.},

  abstract = {As a powerful tool, the vehicular network has been built to connect human communication and transportation around the world for many years to come. However, with the rapid growth of vehicles, the vehicular network becomes heterogeneous, dynamic, and large scaled, which makes it difficult to meet the strict requirements, such as ultralow latency, high reliability, high security, and massive connections of the next-generation (6G) network. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technique to make both the vehicle and wireless communication highly efficient and adaptable. Naturally, employing ML into vehicular communication and network becomes a hot topic and is being widely studied in both academia and industry, paving the way for the future intelligentization in 6G vehicular networks. In this article, we provide a survey on various ML techniques applied to communication, networking, and security parts in vehicular networks and envision the ways of enabling AI toward a future 6G vehicular network, including the evolution of intelligent radio (IR), network intelligentization, and self-learning with proactive exploration.},

  abstract   = {Today’s Internet is experiencing a massive number of users with a continuously increasing need for data, which is the leading cause of introduced limitations among security and privacy issues. To overcome these limitations, a shift from host-centric to data-centric is proposed, and in this context, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) represents a promising solution. Nevertheless, unsettling the current Internet’s network layer – i.e., Internet Protocol (IP) – with ICN is a challenging, expensive task since it requires worldwide coordination among Internet Service Providers (ISPs), backbone, and Autonomous Services (AS). Therefore, researchers foresee that the replacement process of the current Internet will transition through the coexistence of IP and ICN. In this perspective, novel architectures combine IP and ICN protocols. However, only a few of the proposed architectures place the security-by-design feature. Therefore, this article provides the first comprehensive Security and Privacy (SP) analysis of the state-of-the-art IP-ICN coexistence architectures by horizontally comparing the SP features among three deployment approaches – i.e., overlay, underlay, and hybrid – and vertically comparing among the ten considered SP features. Lastly, the article sheds light on the open issues and possible future directions for IP-ICN coexistence. Our analysis shows that most architectures fail to provide several SP features, including data and traffic flow confidentiality, availability, and anonymity of communication. Thus, this article shows the secure combination of current and future protocol stacks during the coexistence phase that the Internet will definitely walk across.},

Significant advances have been made to achieve these objectives. However, the idea of a self-driving car completing its goals without human intervention in the presence of uncertainties is still posed with challenges. These challenges mostly relate to decision-making under uncertainties that could arise from transient faults or deliberate attempts to disrupt the system in favor of adversarial motives. Traditional schemes of hardening the system against known compromises will not suffice primarily because of the sophistication adversarial attempts have come to achieve and the rate at which new attacks are being devised. The problem demands a solution that is resilient to attacks and that would allow a self-driving vehicle to complete its designated task in the presence of attacks or faults. Several attempts have been made towards achieving resilience in autonomous vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to give a thorough review on the resilient approaches adopted in the context and presents a taxonomy of such approaches. The paper also includes a brief introduction to the architecture of self-driving vehicles and its vulnerabilities in the presented context. This paper also discusses a novel approach using N-version programming for resilience.},

By relying on wireless communication and data collected from diverse sensors, ITS is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. With the increasing number of attacks on ITS worldwide, detecting and addressing cybersecurity threats has become critically important. This need will only intensify with the impending arrival of autonomous vehicles. One of the primary challenges is identifying critical ITS assets that require protection and understanding the vulnerabilities that cyber attackers can exploit. Additionally, creating a standard profile for ITS is challenging due to the dynamic traffic pattern, which exhibits changes in the movement of vehicles over time. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an information fusion-based cybersecurity threat detection method. Specffically, we employ the Kalman filter for noise reduction, Dempster-Shafer decision theory and Shannon’s entropy for assessing the probabilities of traffic conditions being normal, intruded, and uncertain. We utilised Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) to simulate the Melbourne CBD map and historical traffic data from the Victorian transport authority. Our simulation results reveal that information fusion with three sensor data is more effective in detecting normal traffic conditions. On the other hand, for detecting anomalies, information fusion with two sensor data is more efficient.},

Over the last few decades, several technologies are introduced for developing NIDS to ensure a high degree of privacy and reliability.

  abstract   = {The rapid growth of the IoT applications in smart homes, medical devices and industry 4.0 has brought huge benefits to our society and industry however faces several challenges in terms of security and privacy issues. Due to its heterogeneous architecture, lack of standard security frameworks between layers, lack of secured communication protocols and lack of resources of power, memory and cryptographic functions on edge control, current IoT devices are prone to security attacks at all three main layers: application, network, and physical layer. While there are some attacks such as Sybil, Blackhole, and Malware usually target a specific layer of IoT architecture, other attacks like DDoS and MITM can compromise the security across multiple layers. These types of attacks not only result in the loss of control over sensitive data and the theft of personal information, but they also result in financial and reputational damages. In recent years, the majority of the research has been carried out to develop robust intrusion detection technologies to safeguard the IoT from a wide range of security attacks, either through novel secure network protocols, the use of firmware or encryption techniques. It is also important to detect IoT attacks at different layers while securing it. Consequently various supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques have been found to be effective in detecting them. There is still a lack of research for detecting multilayer attacks as well as new types of attacks in IoT devices. Hence a thorough investigation of multi-layer Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is provided in this article to identify a wide variety of multi-layer attacks and their behavioural patterns. The list of effective ML algorithms is also reviewed along with their training datasets. We have highlighted the challenges and opportunities for future directions of multi-layer intrusion detection research through the taxonomy of multi-layer attacks. We aim to develop a novel computational framework by investigating the similarities in the features of multi-layer attacks for training ML models to overcome existing problems.},

It is possible to detect unknown assaults and DoS floods using traffic anomalies. Users can keep track of the security features of multimedia services by using Traffic Anomaly Detection, which provides an overview of traffic anomaly detection analysis. Anomaly detection methods fall into three categories: unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised. The right anomaly detection technique basically depends on the labels that are present in the dataset. To further improve the accuracy of proposed model, a new semi-supervised technique for detecting VANET network activity anomalies called SEMI-GRU has been proposed. The results demonstrate that proposed GRU-based deep learning model outperforms existing methods in detecting network anomalies with low false positive rates.},

With the advent of new generation wireless networks and the massive digitalization of industries, the object of protection has changed. The digital transformation has led to an increased opportunity for cybercriminals. The ability of computational intelligence to quickly process large amounts of data makes the intrusions tailored to specific environments. Polymorphic attacks that have mutations in their sequences of acts adapt to the communication environments, operating systems and service frameworks, and also try to deceive the defense tools. The poor protection of most Internet of Things devices allows the attackers to take control over them creating the megabotnets. In this regard, traditional methods of network protection become rigid and low-effective.

Advanced machine learning and artificial neural networks are promising in detection of false data injections. Bioinformatics methods make it possible to detect polymorphic attacks. Swarm intelligence detects dynamic routing anomalies. Quantum machine learning is effective at processing the large volumes of security-relevant datasets.

Due to the rapid development of Internet-connected systems and Artificial Intelligence in recent years, Artificial Intelligence including Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) has been widely utilized in the fields of cyber security including intrusion detection, malware detection, and spam filtering. However, although Artificial Intelligence-based approaches for the detection and defense of cyber attacks and threats are more advanced and efficient compared to the conventional signature-based and rule-based cyber security strategies, most ML-based techniques and DL-based techniques are deployed in the “black-box” manner, meaning that security experts and customers are unable to explain how such procedures reach particular conclusions. The deficiencies of transparencies and interpretability of existing Artificial Intelligence techniques would decrease human users’ confidence in the models utilized for the defense against cyber attacks, especially in current situations where cyber attacks become increasingly diverse and complicated. Therefore, it is essential to apply XAI in the establishment of cyber security models to create more explainable models while maintaining high accuracy and allowing human users to comprehend, trust, and manage the next generation of cyber defense mechanisms. Although there are papers reviewing Artificial Intelligence applications in cyber security areas and the vast literature on applying XAI in many fields including healthcare, financial services, and criminal justice, the surprising fact is that there are currently no survey research articles that concentrate on XAI applications in cyber security. Therefore, the motivation behind the survey is to bridge the research gap by presenting a detailed and up-to-date survey of XAI approaches applicable to issues in the cyber security field. Our work is the first to propose a clear roadmap for navigating the XAI literature in the context of applications in cyber security.},

An important application domain is vehicular networks wherein ML-based approaches are found to be very useful to address various problems. The use of wireless communication between vehicular nodes and/or infrastructure makes it vulnerable to different types of attacks. In this regard, ML and its variants are gaining popularity to detect attacks and deal with different kinds of security issues in vehicular communication. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of ML-based techniques for different security issues in vehicular networks. We first briefly introduce the basics of vehicular networks and different types of communications. Apart from the traditional vehicular networks, we also consider modern vehicular network architectures. We propose a taxonomy of security attacks in vehicular networks and discuss various security challenges and requirements. We classify the ML techniques developed in the literature according to their use in vehicular network applications. We explain the solution approaches and working principles of these ML techniques in addressing various security challenges and provide insightful discussion. The limitations and challenges in using ML-based methods in vehicular networks are discussed. Finally, we present observations and lessons learned before we conclude our work.},

Attacks have become more aggressive, and attackers have become more strategic. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) proposed by standardization bodies cannot solely defend against these attacks. Thus, in complementary of that, sophisticated systems should be designed to detect such attacks and attackers. Machine Learning (ML) has recently emerged as a key enabler to secure future roads.

We validate our solution by comparing a set of selected algorithms available in WEKA.

Such networks are, however, also prone to various cyber threats to data integrity, privacy, authentication, and network availability, and given the potential risk to life under the event of a malfunction and misinformation, it is important to provide security measures against such threats. This paper presents the Multi-branch Reconstruction Error (MbRE) Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for edge-based anomaly detection in VANETs for data integrity, network availability and user authentication-based misbehaviors without the need to train on them. Vehicular data is first sequenced and separated into three data branches - frequency (F) derived from the message timestamps, pseudo-identities (I), and the motion data (M) i.e. position and velocity. The proposed model comprises of three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based reconstruction models trained to reconstruct normal F-I-M vehicular behavior. The IDS classifies each branch of a sequence as 0/1 based on the reconstruction error threshold for the respective branch and, therefore, has the ability to detect 8 possible binary encoded behaviors for each sequence of vehicular data. These results are then used to find the overall behavior of each vehicle using carefully selected detection thresholds. MbRE is able to classify frequency, identity and motion-based behavior samples with an accuracy of 100%, 98.5-100%, and 95.4-100%, respectively, without the need to train on such behaviors. The study also emulates the IDS on Google Colaboratory and Jetson Nano to show its practicality in cloud and edge environments.},

Blockchain is an immutable, distributed, decentralized, smart contract-based technology that provides an efficient solution to VANET requirements and their corresponding attacks. This paper discusses various such requirements and attacks and their possible solutions with Blockchain. Apart from that, Blockchain also acts as a prominent solution to deal with the challenges being faced by electric and autonomous vehicles to come to reality. We have reviewed, analyzed, and discussed the proficient researcher's works and their contributions in this paper to unfold new directions in the present and future research. Further, we have analyzed and discussed the insurance, and forensic management is amalgamated with Blockchain by various researchers to create an automatic assessment protocol. Future possibilities for smart and connected vehicles with Blockchain could be a major objective of this paper.},

A issue in 6G network communication is security and privacy due to the environment's diversity and dynamic nature. The solutions to these problems can be found in blockchain technology. Additionally, it is anticipated that Artificial Intelligence (AI) would be used to build the 6G communication network, enabling the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to address a variety of issues. Despite the fact that previous ML algorithms required massive data repositories and processing by a central server, this approach has become a hindrance in dealing with large data in practice due to rising privacy concerns. In this paper, we give an overview of the various privacy tactics employed in vehicular communication networks and then look into 6G-driven privacy-preserving methods. We discussed about the Internet-of-(IoE) Everything's potential privacy applications and ongoing research questions on privacy protection in the context of 6G vehicular communication.},

  abstract   = {A cyber-communication infrastructure is required for physical components like control systems, sensors, actuators, and the environment to communicate and collaborate in real-time effectively. This is what cyber-physical systems (CPSs) provide. Deep Learning (DL) techniques have sped up and improved the progress of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in recent years, especially in problem domains traditionally addressed with analytical or statistical solutions. In addition to advancing driverless vehicle development to a new level, the improvements brought about by DL applications have led to better traffic organization and scheduling, increased security and safety on transit roads, reduced maintenance costs, and optimized performance for public transportation ride-sharing companies. The primary goal of this work is to offer a complete study and awareness of the uses of DL models on ITS, as well as to demonstrate the development in ITS research that has been owing to DL studies. This article briefly introduces the reader to various DL methods before thoroughly examining and describing how these methods are now being used in the transportation sector. Deep learning models are trained on this real-world traffic information to detect better and forecast the probability of crashes. This work aims to do just that by providing a multi-perspective assessment of deep learning-based techniques for traffic forecasting This paper offers a summary and taxonomy of current traffic forecast systems. We provide a compilation of the most cutting-edge methods currently used for traffic forecasting. In addition, we assess the efficacy of various approaches using a public, real-world dataset and provide an evaluation and analysis of our findings. These findings demonstrate that, related to state-of-the-art shallow models, a deep model is superior at traffic detection and achieves equivalent results in terms of traffic prediction. We suggest a new deep learning framework, an Attention-based hybrid Convolutional Neural network with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (AHCNLS), to perform real-time traffic prediction from a data mining approach to enhance driver and passenger safety. The suggested approach considers the spatial and temporal connection between GPS trajectories and contextual elements. Using a publicly available dataset, our proposed technique is evaluated and shown to have advantages over competing methods.},

  abstract = {Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) have become increasingly popular because they support effective coordination in connected vehicles. ITSs present an integrated approach for exchanging relevant information in order to improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of road transportation systems. A variant of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) called vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are an integral component of ITSs. VANETs consist of interconnected vehicles with sensing abilities that exchange information related to traffic, positioning, weather, and emergency services. In general, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) refers to communications between any entity and a vehicle, where the entity may be a vehicle, a cloud-based network, a pedestrian, or equipment installed along a road. One of the crucial challenges in V2X is the reliable and timely circulation of information among vehicular nodes to allow drivers to make decisions that increase road safety. In this context, efficient V2X routing protocols play a key role in supporting reliability and safety, and enhancing the overall quality of service (QoS) in VANETs. However, VANETs have distinct characteristics, such as high vehicular node mobility, unsteady connectivity, rapid changes in network topology, and unbounded network size, that can significantly affect routing in the network. Various routing protocols for V2X communication exist in the open technical literature. In this survey, we categorize the routing mechanisms as non-learning- and learning-based approaches, and discuss existing V2X routing protocols and their contributions to and impacts on VANET performance. Here, the learning-based approach implies the use of machine learning algorithms. This survey also summarizes open challenges in designing effective V2X routing protocols and future research directions to consider when developing smart routing mechanisms for next-generation intelligent VANET technologies.},

The limited channel capacity of the wireless medium and high message rates needed for adequate situational awareness create a dilemma between the conflicting goals of congestion control and awareness control algorithms. To ensure reliable delivery, vehicles need to interact with a complex and dynamic environment to determine the appropriate message rate and power for their transmissions at any given time. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework where vehicles use reinforcement learning (RL) to intelligently select their transmission parameters based on the current channel conditions. Our simulation results indicate that RL methods can provide a flexible solution for adaptive congestion control by designing the appropriate reward function.},

The self organized with high mobility in VANET makes any vehicle can transmit malicious messages to some other vehicle in the network. In the defense horizon of VANETs this is a matter of concern. It is the duty of RSU to ensure the safe transmission of sensitive information across the Network to each node. For this, network access exists as the key safety prerequisite, and several risks or attacks can be experienced. The VANETs is vulnerable to a range of security attacks including masquerading, selfish node attack, Sybil attack etc. One of the main threats to network access is this Denial of Service attack.

While exchanging data between vehicles in the network, security is a main constraint. ICTS encompasses many facilities and claims, such as managing road traffic, traveler data, public transportation systems, and autonomous vehicles. It is anticipated that ICTS will make significant contributions to future smart cities and urban design in road and traffic security, transportation and transport optimization, energy efficiency, and environmental pollution control. Flexibility, variety of quality-of-service needs, and massive volumes of data generated all present challenges when working with ITS. Previous works on cyber-physical attack detection lag in ensuring security at various levels. To monitor In-Vehicle Networks (IVN), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communications, and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Networks for malicious behavior, we introduce a deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for ICTS. In this research, we look into how Deep Learning (DL), a relatively new but rapidly growing subject, could help improve ICTS. This research investigates whether deep learning can enhance the security of autonomous vehicles and other forms of smart transportation. We improve the smart transport network using the deep learning method, simulate it, and statistically study its data transmission economy, accuracy projections of the future, and path-switching strategy. To identify malicious activity in the core networks of autonomous vehicles (AV), we have developed an ensemble Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) technique based on Deep Learning architecture. The car hacking dataset (used to monitor communications within a vehicle) and the UNSWNB15 dataset (used to monitor communications with the outside world) are used to test and compare the performance of the proposed IDS. The experimental findings showed that our suggested system outperformed other intrusion detection methods by achieving 100% accuracy in detecting all sorts of assaults on the auto-hacking dataset and 99% on the UNSW-NB15 dataset.},

In addition, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in IoD confront several obstacles because of the dynamic network architecture, particularly in balancing detection accuracy and efficiency. To increase the performance of the IoD network, we proposed a blockchain-based radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) model in this article.

We discussed the usage of blockchain to create decentralized predictive analytics and a model for effectively applying and sharing deep learning (DL) methods in a decentralized fashion. We also assessed the model using a variety of data sets to demonstrate the viability and efficacy of implementing the blockchain-based DL technique in IoD contexts. The findings showed that the suggested model is an excellent option for developing classifiers while adhering to the constraints placed by network intrusion detection. Furthermore, the proposed model can outperform the cutting-edge methods in terms of specificity, F1, recall, precision, and accuracy.},

This paper develops a novel network intrusion detection system for VANET that leverages Spark-based big data optimization and transfer learning (NIDS-VSB). First, a packet parser is used to crawl network traffic and filter required flow events. Next, the Spark-based optimization method is implemented to process large amounts of data efficiently. Furthermore, a transfer learning strategy is designed to learn the comprehensive feature representation using their semantic anchors. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used to extract deep features from semantic anchors. Finally, a stacking generalization ensemble model uses deep features to detect various attacks.

BCOOL exhibits a linear complexity and a strong resilience to failures. Simulation results show that BCOOL outperforms the next best comparable strategies by 80% and 100% reliability and efficiency gains in challenging data congestion environments. This yields to fast, reliable and accurate congestion prediction decisions, ahead of time, and optimizes transaction validation processing time.

This study aims to review and analyse literature related to data exchange in V2V communications systems. The factors considered to improve the understanding of the field's various contextual aspects were derived from published studies. We systematically searched all articles about the classification and detection of data exchange in vehicles, as well as their evaluation. Three main databases, namely, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore from 2008 to 2018, were used. These indices were considered sufficiently extensive to encompass our literature. On the basis of our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 140 articles were selected. Most articles (53/140) are studies conducted in a V2V communication system; a number of papers (51/140) covered the actual attempts to develop V2V communications; and few papers (18/140) comprised framework proposals and architectures. The last portion (18/140) of articles presented review and survey articles. V2V collision avoidance system, which is a field requiring automated solutions, tools and methods, entails the capability to facilitate early detection. Several studies have been performed on the automatic detection of V2V and their subtypes to promote accurate detection. The basic characteristics of this emerging field are identified from the aspects of motivations, open challenges that impede the technology's utility, authors' recommendations and substantial analysis of the previous studies are discussed based on seven aspect (devices, number of scenario, test location, types of sensors, number of vehicle, evaluation techniques used and types of software). A propose research methodology as new direction is provided to solve the gaps identified in the analysis. This methodology consists of four phases; investigation, develop a hardware system, study and analysis, and evaluation phases. However, research areas on V2V communication with the scope of data exchange are varied. This systematic review is expected to open opportunities for researchers and encourage them to work on the identified gaps.},

The proposed scheme includes: (i) An architecture based on Fog Cloud Vehicular Adhoc Networks. (ii) The solution based on the public key cryptography to protect the privacy using an efficient privacy protection scheme. (iii) Identify, Investigate and analyze the 4 different dynamic routing protocol among using the simulation and record the obtained results for each protocol, performed the graphical analysis of the obtained result over the simulation duration. The identified best routing protocol is used on the model in the VANET communication along with the implementation of ECC to analyze the performance impact. Lastly, the performance is evaluated after the implementation of the proposed solution.},

  abstract   = {In recent years, the use of Software Defined Networking (SDN) has increased due to various network management requirements. Using SDN in computer network applications has brought several benefits to users, including lower operational costs, better hardware management, flexibility, and centralized network deployment. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) is another rapidly growing technology. Distributed and dynamic infrastructures are two critical characteristics of IoT. These characteristics lead to some challenges while using SDN in IoT in terms of security and privacy. In this paper, we address security and privacy issues and solutions for SDN-based IoT systems. We analyze the techniques used for defense in previous works to achieve an acceptable level of security and privacy protection in SDN-based IoT systems. In the data plane, SDN-based IoT papers have considered hashing and encryption techniques, in the control plane, certificate authority and access control have been analyzed, and in the application plane, attack detection, and authentication have been discussed. We also provide a statistical analysis of the existing work. This analysis shows that researchers have focused on certain areas more than others in recent years. The final analysis also highlights issues that previous researchers have ignored.},

In CPS, the real world and the computing systems are connected through networks with real-time information exchange. The introduction of networking technologies in CPS has substantial advantages in terms of system efficiency, scalability, maintenance, and many more. However, CPS are vulnerable to malicious attackers intruding on the network. The attackers aim to destroy the physical systems with cyber-physical attacks, in which the main objective is to remotely cause malfunctions in physical systems through networks. Therefore, extensive research on cyber-physical security has been conducted to detect cyber-physical attacks and guarantee the stability of the physical systems under cyber-physical attacks. In this survey, we conduct an exhaustive review of the literature on threats to CPS and on resilient CPS design strategies. First, we discuss the structure of CPS, considering physical dynamics, computing systems, and networks. Then, we provide a taxonomy of cyber-physical attacks with three properties (attack space, attack location, and stealthiness). These three attributes represent the requirements for the implementation of cyber-physical attacks. We review existing studies on anomaly-detection strategies against cyber-physical attacks in terms of physics, networks, and machine learning techniques. Moreover, we analyze the impact of typical cyber-physical attacks and the constraints on attack implementations. In particular, for each of the well-established cyber-physical attacks, we present numerical examples that clearly illustrate the time responses of the physical systems with a conventional physics-based anomaly detector. We also review advances in the typical cyber-physical attacks and the detection methods for these attacks. Furthermore, we review resilient CPS designs in the context of control theory, network management, and data-driven technologies. We conclude the survey by identifying future research directions.},

The IIoTs are responsible for critical data collection and transmission to cloud servers to address life-dependent problems. However, these cyber-physical devices are vulnerable to network attacks such as selective forwarding, flooding, and Sybil attacks. Meanwhile, behavioural patterns characterise the IIoT devices under such attacks due to their effect on transmission latency, power consumption, and computational time. Hence, this paper presents a multi-trust security system to monitor and record these parameters, such as network byte-in and byte-out, CPU usage, and energy consumption on the IIoT device. Based on the ML model, we created an efficient multi-trust attack detection system (M-TADS) to detect denial of service attacks (DoS) in the IIoT. IIoT devices have resource constraints that practically prevent them from fully implementing the proposed M-TADS on the same cyber-physical device. Hence, the captured parameters from the IIoT devices are offloaded to a deep neural network model created with long short term memory (LSTM). The LSTM is hosted on a multi-access edge computing (MEC) server at the network edge to determine the possible existence of the DoS attack signature. Due to the high latency accompanying DoS attack, we introduce a custom hold and check filter on the IIoT devices. The proposed M-TADS performance is verified through simulations, and the results confirm high performance in terms of throughput, energy consumption, packet delay, and IIoT network DoS attack detection accuracy.},

This study focuses on techniques for detecting and classifying misbehavior in VANETs while dealing with unbalanced data.

This approach separates binary classifiers for each kind of misbehavior and provides specific assessment metrics for each kind of misbehavior. We evaluate our experiment using five-fold cross-validation with six individual models of ML and an ensemble classifier. The findings demonstrated that the use of OVA-BT enhances the classification accuracy when compared to a traditional single multi-class model and that the classifier ensemble’s classification performance is greater than the best individual model on the testing set.},

To maintain message reliability, it is crucial to establish a trust management model that can promptly detect malicious vehicles and identify false messages. This paper presents a novel trust management model based on blockchain, machine learning, and active detection technology. In the proposed model, we designed a trust evaluation scheme to evaluate the credibility by calculating the direct and indirect trust of the vehicle. To achieve this goal, we use active detection technology to detect indirect trust in vehicles, and then store it in the blockchain. The direct trust of the vehicle is calculated using a Bayesian classifier. The use of active detection technology speeds up the process of filtering out malicious vehicles. Machine learning technology simplifies the complex iterations involved in computing the trust value. Finally, the use of blockchain ensures the consistency and tamper-proofing of the trusted data. The simulation outcomes demonstrate that our approach outperforms the present trust management models.},

  abstract   = {Software-defined networking (SDN) uses a controller to manage the network. Applying SDN to resist distributed denial-of-service flood (DDoS-F) attacks receives attention. A controller identifies attack flows and gives rules to switches to discard attack packets. Doing so may cause the controller to be busy and impact SDN performance. P4 switches, on the other hand, can recognize DDoS-F attacks without controller involvement. However, some non-DDoS attacks like keylogging and data theft cannot be well identified by P4 switches due to their local views. Thus, the paper makes the controller and P4 switches cooperate to defend against hybrid network attacks that include both DDoS-F attacks and non-DDoS attacks. To this end, we propose a collaborative defense by control and data planes (CD2P) framework. P4 switches (i.e., data plane) find DDoS-F packets by using an entropy-aware detection scheme that can adjust thresholds based on the network status. They also report flow information (excluding DDoS-F flows) to the controller. With the deep learning technique, the controller (i.e., control plane) analyzes these reports to discover non-DDoS attacks. Hence, the controller can focus on detecting these attacks without the disturbance of many DDoS-F packets. Experimental results reveal that CD2P can quickly block DDoS-F attacks and better identify keylogging and data theft. Our contribution is to propose a novel framework for the controller and P4 switches to collaborate to defend against hybrid network attacks efficiently.},

IoV helps in enhancing driving aids with the help of vehicle Artificial Intelligence (AI) awareness of other vehicles and their actions. IoV is connected in an adhoc networking environment which utilizes each vehicle in the network as a node, called Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET), where the vehicles may be also connected to the public Internet. It is specifically important for the autonomous vehicles because they can instantaneously communicate with other vehicles surrounding them. In addition, safely avoiding accident prone zones is crucial in order to continue secure and smart transportation. Since the communication among various entities involved in the IoV environment is via open channel, it gives an opportunity to a passive/active adversary to intercept, modify, delete or even insert fake information during communication. It is then a serious concern for the vehicles users to determine whether the received information is genuine. In this survey paper, various security aspects, threats and attacks, network and threat models related to the IoV environment are discussed. Next, a taxonomy of security protocols is given that is essential to provide IoV data security. In particular, focus on various authentication protocols is given that is needed for mutual authentication among the involved entities in the IoV environment for secure communication. A detailed comparative analysis among various state-of-art authentication protocols proposed in the related IoV environment is provided to show their effectiveness as well as security and functionality features. Moreover, some testbeds are described that were designed and implemented for the IoV environment.

Cargo carried by ships must be loaded and unloaded quickly with minimal stopover time in the port. This requirement mandates seaports to deploy cutting-edge technology to the port area so that logistic processes are increasingly efficient and reliable. In this scenario, the attack surface of such critical infrastructure is growing very rapidly and advanced security techniques must be deployed to enforce a high attack resilience. A Distributed Ledger-based Credential Management System exploiting a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to enable transparent and real-time tracking of logistic vehicles and cargos within a terminal is presented in this paper. Based on a customization of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) security standards, the proposed scheme provides authentication, authorization, and revocation capabilities to promptly exclude misbehaving logistic vehicles from the system, while maintaining an immutable record of all the logistic vehicles' activity. The laboratory validation demonstrates that the delay of the devised scheme is not dependent on the quay area capacity, thus being applicable in seaports of any size. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the solution is demonstrated with the field trial results obtained with the EU Horizon 2020 COREALIS project testbed deployed in the Port of Livorno.},

With the benefits of realizing decentralized, traceable, and trusted data sharing, blockchain can provide controllers with information such as inter-domain links and the global view to assist achieving global controller load balancing. We propose one global controller load-balancing method based on blockchain in this paper. Our proposed method adopts in-band telemetry (INT) so as to sense the status of each network domain, and combine the load of the controller itself. This enables to package and upload the chain to form a decentralized data-sharing model. Based on the load and network domain status of the global controller, combined with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm analysis, a specific solution is obtained, and some edge switches in the network domain of the overloaded controller are selected for migration, thereby achieving global load balancing. The method in this paper can not only integrate global information and reduce migration costs, but also ensure that domain information is not leaked. Simulation results show its convergence and effectiveness.},

Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) can enhance the ability of emerging resource-intensive IoT applications and has attracted much attention. However, due to the time-varying network environments, as well as the heterogeneous resources of network devices, it is hard to achieve stable, reliable, and real-time interactions between edge devices and their serving edge servers, especially in the 5G ultradense network (UDN) scenarios. Ultradense edge computing (UDEC) has the potential to fill this gap, especially in the 5G era, but it still faces challenges in its current solutions, such as the lack of: 1) efficient utilization of multiple 5G resources (e.g., computation, communication, storage, and service resources); 2) low overhead offloading decision making and resource allocation strategies; and 3) privacy and security protection schemes. Thus, we first propose an intelligent UDEC (I-UDEC) framework, which integrates blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) into 5G UDEC networks. Then, in order to achieve real-time and low overhead computation offloading decisions and resource allocation strategies, we design a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (2Ts-DRL) approach, consisting of a fast-timescale and a slow-timescale learning process, respectively. The primary objective is to minimize the total offloading delay and network resource usage by jointly optimizing computation offloading, resource allocation, and service caching placement. We also leverage federated learning (FL) to train the 2Ts-DRL model in a distributed manner, aiming to protect the edge devices' data privacy. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of both the 2Ts-DRL and FL in the I-UDEC framework and prove that our proposed algorithm can reduce task execution time up to 31.87%.},

Moreover, emerging applications and services necessitate massive volumes of data, real-time data processing, and ultrareliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). However, the computing capability of current intelligent vehicles is minimal, making it challenging to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive demand of such applications. In this situation, vehicular task/computation offloading toward the edge cloud (EC) and vehicular cloudlet (VC) seems to be a promising solution to improve the network’s performance and applications’ Quality of Service (QoS). At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically changed people’s lives.

Motivated by the outstanding performance of integrating reinforcement learning (RL)/deep RL (DRL) to the vehicular task offloading systems, we present a survey on various RL/DRL techniques applied to vehicular task offloading. Precisely, we classify the vehicular task offloading works into two main categories: 1) RL/ DRL solutions leveraging EC and 2) RL/DRL solutions using VC computing. Moreover, the EC section-based RL/DRL solutions are further subcategorized into multiaccess edge computing (MEC) server, nearby vehicles, and hybrid MEC (HMEC). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to cover RL/DRL-based vehicular task offloading. Also, we provide lessons learned and open research challenges in this field and discuss the possible trend for future research.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, modern vehicles are becoming even more connected, intelligent, and smart. A modern vehicle encloses several cyber–physical systems, such as actuators and sensors, which are controlled by electronic control units (ECUs). Such ECUs are connected through in-vehicle networks, and, in turn, such networks are connected to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to provide advanced and smart features. However, the increase in vehicle connectivity and computerization, although it brings clear advantages, it introduces serious safety problems that can also endanger the life of the driver and passengers of the vehicle, as well as that of pedestrians. Such problems are mainly caused by the security weaknesses affecting the controller area network (CAN) bus, used to exchange data between ECUs. In this article, we provide two algorithms that implement a data-driven anomaly detection system. The first algorithm (cluster-based learning algorithm), is used to learn the behavior of messages passing on the CAN bus, for base-lining purposes, while the second one (data-driven anomaly detection algorithm) is used to perform real-time classification of such messages (licit or illicit) for early alerting in the presence of malicious usages. The experimental results, obtained by using data coming from a real vehicle, have shown that our approach is capable of performing better than other anomaly detection-based approaches.},

These attacks present safety concerns and may render the whole communication network ineffective. Designing an anti-jamming solution for CAVs and VANETs is non-trivial because every jamming scenario presents itself with unique characteristics. In this paper, we extend our previous work in Alam (2021) by proposing a scheme that localizes jamming vehicles, maps the jammed area, and prevents the jamming vehicles from sending and/or receiving beacons in the network. To achieve these objectives, we apply Centroid Localization (CL), Graham Scan Hull Algorithm (GSHA), and bloom filter data structure. The novelties of our work are three-fold. 1) We dynamically change the X, Y positions and radii of the jamming vehicles. 2) We implement multiple jamming attack scenarios with multiple jammers and varying number of vehicles. 3) We prevent the jamming vehicles from sending messages in the network. Simulation results show that on average, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.77%, a precision of 99.14%, a recall of 93.54%, and an F1 score of 96.03% for all the attack scenarios implemented.},

Machine learning is regarded as an promising technology to achieve such a goal, which has attracted efforts of many researchers. However, the literature still lacks a review on current research advance. In this paper, we review existing intelligent routing schemes based on machine learning in Inte-HetNets. We first introduce mainstream machine learning methods applied into routing. Then, we provide a taxonomy of learning-empowered routing schemes in Inte- HetNets by classifying them into three types based on routing scenarios: routing in ad hoc networks, routing in fixed backbone networks, and routing across network domains. Subsequently, we propose a set of requirements on learning-empowered routing in Inte-HetNets and employ these requirements to review the current literature. Finally, we explore several open issues based on our review and indicate future research directions of intelligent routing in Inte-HetNets.},

Both forms use the data communications between Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I/I2V) and other on-road entities, and are accelerating the adoption of self-driving cars. The development of cyber-physical systems containing advanced sensors, sub-systems, and smart driving assistance applications over the past decade is equipping unmanned aerial and road vehicles with autonomous decision-making capabilities. The level of autonomy depends upon the make-up and degree of sensor sophistication and the vehicle's operational applications. As a result, self-driving cars are being compromised perceived as a serious threat. Therefore, analyzing the threats and attacks on self-driving cars and ITSs, and their corresponding countermeasures to reduce those threats and attacks are needed. For this reason, some survey papers compiling potential attacks on VANETs, ITSs and self-driving cars, and their detection mechanisms are available in the current literature. However, up to our knowledge, they have not covered the real attacks already happened in self-driving cars. To bridge this research gap, in this paper, we analyze the attacks that already targeted self-driving cars and extensively present potential cyber-attacks and their impacts on those cars along with their vulnerabilities. For recently reported attacks, we describe the possible mitigation strategies taken by the manufacturers and governments. This survey includes recent works on how a self-driving car can ensure resilient operation even under ongoing cyber-attack. We also provide further research directions to improve the security issues associated with self-driving cars.},

In this research, we introduce an innovative Software as a Service (SaaS)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed specifically for the unique challenges of IoMT, deploying at the edge for enhanced efficiency. Our proposed IDS incorporates a multi-faceted approach: Firstly, it leverages the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for feature engineering, optimizing data representation to reduce computational overhead on resource-constrained devices. Secondly, a diverse ensemble of machine learning and deep learning models is employed to detect a wide array of intrusion attempts within IoMT networks. Thirdly, interpretation is achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), providing transparency and understanding of the decision-making process. By combining intelligence, efficiency, explainability, and deploying as a SaaS solution at the network edge, our IDS not only bolsters the security of resource-constrained IoMT devices but also empowers healthcare professionals with actionable insights, ensuring patient data privacy and network integrity in this dynamic and critical domain. Finally, the results using a publicly available healthcare dataset namely WUSTL-EHMS-2020 proves the effectiveness of the proposed IDS over some recent state-of-the-art works.},

This design eliminates the need for central coordinators to achieve fully decentralized operations. IronForge runs in a public and open network and launches a fair incentive mechanism by enabling state consistency in the DAG. Hence, the system fits in networks where training resources are unevenly distributed. In addition, dedicated defense strategies against prevalent FL attacks on incentive fairness and data privacy are presented to ensure the security of IronForge. Experimental results based on a newly developed test bed FLSim highlight the superiority of IronForge to the existing prevalent FL frameworks under various specifications in performance, fairness, and security. To the best of our knowledge, IronForge is the first secure and fully decentralized FL (DFL) framework that can be applied in open networks with realistic network and training settings.},

We have underscored the importance of integrating robust security mechanisms to safeguard the control plane and maintain the overall security of SDN architectures. Our comprehensive analysis of control plane attacks in SDN elucidates the evolving security challenges posed by the programmability and centralization of network control.

Cybertwin (CT) is a next-generation networking architecture that serves as a communication, and digital asset owner, and can make the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network flexible and secure. However, CT itself can publish end users’ digital assets to other entities as a service, making data security and privacy major obstacles in the realization of V2X applications. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, this article presents BDTwin, a blockchain and deep-learning-based integrated framework to enhance security and privacy in CT-driven V2X applications. Specifically, a blockchain scheme is designed to ensure secure communication among vehicles, roadside units, CT-edge server, and cloud server using a smart contract-based enhance-Proof-of-Work (ePoW) and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-based verification process. Smart contracts are used to enforce rules and regulations that govern the behavior of V2X entities in a nondeniable and automated manner. In a deep-learning scheme, an autoregressive-deep variational autoencoder model is combined with attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (A-BLSTM) for automatic feature extraction and attack detection by analyzing CT-edge servers data in a V2X environment. Security analysis and experimental results using two different sources, ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 show the superiority of the proposed BDTwin framework over some baseline and recent state-of-the-art techniques.},

As such, most of the current authentication schemes which incur heavy computation and communication overheads are not suitable in this environment.

Extensive formal security verification using Real or Random (RoR) model shows that it is provably secure. In addition, elaborate semantic security analysis shows that it offers anonymity, untraceability and key secrecy as well as resilience against numerous IoV attack vectors. In terms of performance, comparative evaluations demonstrate that it reduces computation and energy consumptions by 42.31%. Moreover, it increases the supported security features by 26.67%.},

In each category, we identify the associated challenges. We also identify a number of recommendations to inform future research.},

  abstract   = {Internet of Things (IoT) aims to create a vast network with billions of things that can seamlessly create and exchange data, establishing intelligent interactions between people and objects around them. It is characterized with openness, heterogeneity, and dynamicity, which inevitably introduce severe security, privacy, and trust issues that hinder the widespread application of IoT. Trust management (TM) holds great promise in identifying malicious nodes, maintaining trust relationships, and enhancing system security. Traditional TM systems (TMSs) can be classified into centralized, semi-centralized, and distributed ones, all three of which suffer from critical challenges and thus are not sufficient for facilitating IoT development. Blockchain, as a disruptive technology, can help addressing the challenges of TM in IoT, thanks to its advanced features, such as decentralization, consistency, and tamper-proofing. As a result, blockchain-based TM (BC-TM) has been extensively studied in recent years to achieve decentralized TM in IoT. However, it still lacks a comprehensive survey on the current state of the arts. To fill this gap, in this article, we conduct a serious survey on BC-TM in IoT. We first propose a set of evaluation criteria that should be met by a TMS in IoT. Then, we propose a taxonomy of TMSs and continue with a thorough review on BC-TM in IoT by employing the proposed criteria. In the end, based on the review, a series of open issues are identified, and future research directions are suggested.},

HetNets aim to effectively exploit network resources and provide seamless connectivity for heterogeneous objects. Unlike other networks, HetNets hold such characteristics as heterogeneity, openness, distribution, multi-domain involvement, thus are susceptible to various security threats and attacks. Traditional security approaches are not sufficiently effective in defending against them. With extensive study and practice, researchers found that trust models offer effective measures to enhance the security and reliability of a network system. However, there still lacks a comprehensive survey on the recent advances of trust models in HetNets. In this paper, we fill this gap. We first retrospect the history of HetNets research and introduce important concepts related to trust. Then, we propose a set of criteria that a sound trust model should satisfy, which can also serve as a measure to evaluate the quality of a trust model, i.e., Quality of Trust (QoT). We provide taxonomies of trust models and their applications, and continue with a thorough review on trust models in HetNets. Based on the review, a list of open issues is highlighted, and corresponding future research directions are suggested to advance the research on trustworthy HetNets.},

Indeed, one-shot authentication mechanisms challenge the user at the beginning of a session leaving them vulnerable to attacks on lost/stolen devices or session hijacking. In addition, static authentication mechanisms always use the same challenges to authenticate the user without considering the dynamic nature of the risk related to the authentication context. To mitigate these challenges, we propose RLAuth, a risk-based authentication system that can automatically adapt the level of challenge presented to the user on each authentication request based on the current context. RLAuth is based on binary anomaly detection, which is solved using a deep reinforcement learning agent that acts as the classifier. To cope with the high class imbalance in the anomaly detection problem, we propose to use a balanced sampling technique during experience replay and an imbalanced correction factor during reward computation. We evaluate RLAuth on a public dataset using the G-mean metric which is the square root of the product of sensitivity with specificity. This metric is efficient to measure the classification performance of a model under class imbalance since it does not overfit to the majority class. Finally, RLAuth obtained a G-Mean of 92.62%. In addition, the reinforcement learning agent can be trained offline for acceptable results in about 130 s and can then be periodically retrained to improve its performance over time.},

In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars.

In this study, detection and protection systems are designed under a proposed architecture for ECBs with Vehicle-to-Cloud connectivity to address the denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. The analysis conducted in this paper shows that the distributed DDoS attack is most crucial because it is easy to be launched and hard to be defended. By overwhelming traffics with spam, DDoS attacks can easily cut off the vehicle connection to cloud servers and disable all (compromised and surviving) ECBs that rely on vehicle-to-cloud connectivity. The simulation results indicate that, even though 99.9% of ECBs in the system are compromised and converted to attacking sources, with the proposed security systems in the cloud, the blocking probability between servers and surviving filed devices is kept below 28.08%. Besides, for a surviving field device protected by the proposed approach, harsh DDoS attacks only degrade the energy efficiency and battery life performance of the tested energy management system by 0.2288% when compared to the benchmark results.},

Such networks may be self operating or linked to a larger internet and may have one or multiple different transceivers between nodes resulting in a highly dynamic and autonomous topology. The first focus is on MANET attacks followed by detection of the malicious node from MANET via Polynomial-Reduction Algorithm. Although scientists have assessed many algorithms for the detection and rectification of the malicious nodes in the MANETs, the problem still persists. Due to the unprecedented growth in technology, the unidentified vulnerabilities are also intensifying. Therefore, it is very crucial to come up with some ground-breaking ideas to prevent the MANET.

VANETs contribute to improved traffic efficiency, accident safety, and entertainment services for passengers and drivers. However, VANETs face limitations in areas with intermittent connectivity. To address this scenario, researchers have proposed a specialized use-case known as intermittently-connected-vehicular delay-tolerant-networks (ICV-DTNs), which are a subset of delay-tolerant-networks (DTNs). Security is less explored area compare to routing. Malicious nodes pose significant threats by launching selective packet drops, fake/bogus packets, and flood attacks, depleting limited resources such as bandwidth and node buffer space. Consequently, these attacks result in low message delivery ratios and high message loss ratios. Among these attacks, flood attacks are particularly challenging in ICV-DTNs/Flying Adhoc Networks/Internet of Drones. Various algorithms have been proposed to mitigate flood attacks, but previous approaches have exhibited shortcomings. Firstly, previously proposed algorithms lack efficiency in terms of detection time and accuracy. Secondly, the extent of resource waste or savings after implementing these schemes has not been adequately demonstrated, with no simulation results quantifying the amount of buffer consumption. Additionally, prior algorithms lack a comprehensive definition of flood attacks, which represents a critical research question in this field. To address these gaps, this article not only proposed a unique taxonomy of the flooding attacks but also evaluate various algorithms on diverse parameters. The article also contribute open research areas for the community to investigate the nitty gritty of flooding attacks in ICV-DTNs.},

To emulate this research mininet is required to create an SDN environment with inbuilt hosts, switches, controllers, and links among them. This paper aims to improve TCP throughput in an SDN environment by implementing a short-path routing algorithm. In this implementation, a comparison has been made between two case studies: Case study 1 (Host h1 and h2 connected to a single switch), and Case study 2 (Host h2 and h8 connected to separate switches) to see their effect on TCP throughput. This research work is novel because it uses the shortest path routing script following the RYU controller and custom-built tree topology. The two main tools used in this research are openvswitch and iperf 3. This study examines how network throughput can be improved. SDN has become imperative for emerging technologies as its architecture support is suitable for 5G, IoT, VANETs, Blockchain, and networking industries. Incorporating it with other technologies makes it even more intriguing.

Federated learning (FL), as a potential distributed AI paradigm, has allowed UAVs to jointly train a global model without exposing their local sensing data. In the general context, flying things communicate only local model updates. The training process ends when the global model reaches a certain threshold. The centralized curator aggregation model can be subject to diverse threats such as DDoS and single point of failure.

The proposed architecture is apt to cope with FL privacy leakage, insider/outsider attacks, malicious opponents, inference, and poisoning.

We also highlight the reasons in adopting wireless technologies, in particular, IEEE 802.11p and 5G vehicle-to-everything, as well as the use of paradigms able to store and analyze a vast amount of data to produce intelligence and their applications in vehicular environments. We also correlate the use of each of these paradigms with the desire to meet existing intelligent transportation systems' requirements. The presentation of each paradigm is given from a historical and logical standpoint. In particular, vehicular fog computing improves on the deficiences of vehicular cloud computing, so both are not exclusive from the application point of view. We also emphasize some security issues that are linked to the characteristics of these paradigms and vehicular networks, showing that they complement each other and share problems and limitations. As these networks still have many opportunities to grow in both concept and application, we finally discuss concepts and technologies that we believe are beneficial. Throughout this work, we emphasize the crucial role of these concepts for the well-being of humanity.},

IoV relies on VANETs which is based on V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) communication. The vehicles are integrated with various sensors and embedded systems allowing them to gather data related to the situation on the road. The collected data can be information associated with a car accident, the congested highway ahead, parked car, etc. This information exchanged with other neighboring vehicles on the road to promote safe driving. IoV networks are vulnerable to various security attacks. The V2V communication comprises specific vulnerabilities which can be manipulated by attackers to compromise the whole network. In this paper, we concentrate on intrusion detection in IoV and propose a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to detect intruders or attackers on an IoV network. Results are in the form of prediction, classification reports, and confusion matrix. A thorough simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the new MLP-based intrusion detection system.},

However, 5G marks a radical shift from this focus as 5G and beyond networks are being designed to be future-proof by catering to diverse requirements of several use cases. These requirements include Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications, Massive Machine-Type Communications and Enhanced Mobile Broadband. To realize such features in 5G and beyond, there is a need to rethink how current cellular networks are deployed because designing new radio access technologies and utilizing the new spectrum are not enough. Several technologies, such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization, machine learning and cloud computing, are being integrated into the 5G networks to fulfil the need for diverse requirements. These technologies, however, give rise to several challenges associated with decentralization, transparency, interoperability, privacy and security. To address these issues, Blockchain has emerged as a potential solution due to its capabilities such as transparency, data encryption, auditability, immutability and distributed architecture. In this paper, we review the state-of-art application of Blockchain in 5G network and explore how it can facilitate enabling technologies of 5G and beyond to enable various services at the front-haul, edge and the core. Based on the review, we present a taxonomy of Blockchain application in 5G networks and discuss several issues that can be solved using Blockchain integration. We then present various field-trials and Proof of concept that are using Blockchain to address the challenges faced in the current 5G deployment. Finally, we discuss various challenges that need to be addressed to realize the full potential of Blockchain in beyond 5G networks.

However, because of their open operational nature, UAVs are highly vulnerable to severe security breaches via cyber attacks, eavesdropping on navigational and communication links, etc. Given their widespread applications, the requirement of secured UAV communications has become more and more critical since security failures can lead to detrimental consequences. Several works have examined the extent of privacy and security issues in UAV-assisted networks and introduced various mitigation techniques to address different security challenges.

Subsequently, we review existing deployments of FL in ITS across various scenarios, and discuss specific potential issues in object recognition, traffic management, and service providing scenarios. Furthermore, we conduct a further analysis of the new challenges introduced by FL deployment and the inherent limitations that FL alone cannot fully address, including uneven data distribution, limited storage and computing power, and potential privacy and security concerns. We then examine the existing collaborative technologies that can help mitigate these challenges.

Transferring data over a network without requiring any kind of human-to-computer or human-to-human interaction, brings reliability and convenience to consumers, but also opens a new world of opportunity for intruders, and introduces a whole set of unique and complicated questions to the field of Digital Forensics. Although IoT data could be a rich source of evidence, forensics professionals cope with diverse problems, starting from the huge variety of IoT devices and non-standard formats, to the multi-tenant cloud infrastructure and the resulting multi-jurisdictional litigations. A further challenge is the end-to-end encryption which represents a trade-off between users' right to privacy and the success of the forensics investigation. Due to its volatile nature, digital evidence has to be acquired and analyzed using validated tools and techniques that ensure the maintenance of the Chain of Custody. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the main issues involved in the complex process of IoT-based investigations, particularly all legal, privacy and cloud security challenges.

  abstract = {Safety is the most important requirement for autonomous vehicles; hence, the ultimate challenge of designing an edge computing ecosystem for autonomous vehicles is to deliver enough computing power, redundancy, and security so as to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, autonomous driving systems are extremely complex; they tightly integrate many technologies, including sensing, localization, perception, decision making, as well as the smooth interactions with cloud platforms for high-definition (HD) map generation and data storage. These complexities impose numerous challenges for the design of autonomous driving edge computing systems. First, edge computing systems for autonomous driving need to process an enormous amount of data in real time, and often the incoming data from different sensors are highly heterogeneous. Since autonomous driving edge computing systems are mobile, they often have very strict energy consumption restrictions. Thus, it is imperative to deliver sufficient computing power with reasonable energy consumption, to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles, even at high speed. Second, in addition to the edge system design, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) provides redundancy for autonomous driving workloads and alleviates stringent performance and energy constraints on the edge side. With V2X, more research is required to define how vehicles cooperate with each other and the infrastructure. Last, safety cannot be guaranteed when security is compromised. Thus, protecting autonomous driving edge computing systems against attacks at different layers of the sensing and computing stack is of paramount concern. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art approaches in these areas as well as explore potential solutions to address these challenges.},

  abstract = {Millions of sensors continuously produce and transmit data to control real-world infrastructures using complex networks in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, IoT devices are limited in computational power, including storage, processing, and communication resources, to effectively perform compute-intensive tasks locally. Edge computing resolves the resource limitation problems by bringing computation closer to the edge of IoT devices. Providing distributed edge nodes across the network reduces the stress of centralized computation and overcomes latency challenges in the IoT. Therefore, edge computing presents low-cost solutions for compute-intensive tasks. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables effective network management by presenting a global perspective of the network. While SDN was not explicitly developed for IoT challenges, it can, however, provide impetus to solve the complexity issues and help in efficient IoT service orchestration. The current IoT paradigm of massive data generation, complex infrastructures, security vulnerabilities, and requirements from the newly developed technologies make IoT realization a challenging issue. In this research, we provide an extensive survey on SDN and the edge computing ecosystem to solve the challenge of complex IoT management. We present the latest research on Software-Defined Internet of Things orchestration using Edge (SDIoT-Edge) and highlight key requirements and standardization efforts in integrating these diverse architectures. An extensive discussion on different case studies using SDIoT-Edge computing is presented to envision the underlying concept. Furthermore, we classify state-of-the-art research in the SDIoT-Edge ecosystem based on multiple performance parameters. We comprehensively present security and privacy vulnerabilities in the SDIoT-Edge computing and provide detailed taxonomies of multiple attack possibilities in this paradigm. We highlight the lessons learned based on our findings at the end of each section. Finally, we discuss critical insights toward current research issues, challenges, and further research directions to efficiently provide IoT services in the SDIoT-Edge paradigm.},

  abstract = {Having gained momentum from its promise of centralized control over distributed network architectures at bargain costs, software-defined Networking (SDN) is an ever-increasing topic of research. SDN offers a simplified means to dynamically control multiple simple switches via a single controller program, which contrasts with current network infrastructures where individual network operators manage network devices individually. Already, SDN has realized some extraordinary use cases outside of academia with companies, such as Google, AT&T, Microsoft, and many others. However, SDN still presents many research and operational challenges for government, industry, and campus networks. Because of these challenges, many SDN solutions have developed in an ad hoc manner that are not easily adopted by other organizations. Hence, this paper seeks to identify some of the many challenges where new and current researchers can still contribute to the advancement of SDN and further hasten its broadening adoption by network operators.},

This paper primarily surveys the literature that has applied theoretical games to wireless networks, emphasizing use cases of upcoming multiaccess edge computing (MEC). MEC is relatively new and offers cloud services at the network periphery, aiming to reduce service latency backhaul load, and enhance relevant operational aspects such as quality of experience or security. Our presentation of GT is focused on the major challenges imposed by MEC services over the wireless resources. The survey is divided into classical and evolutionary games. Then, our discussion proceeds to more specific aspects which have a considerable impact on the game's usefulness, namely, rational versus evolving strategies, cooperation among players, available game information, the way the game is played (single turn, repeated), the game's model evaluation, and how the model results can be applied for both optimizing resource-constrained resources and balancing diverse tradeoffs in real edge networking scenarios. Finally, we reflect on lessons learned, highlighting future trends and research directions for applying theoretical model games in upcoming MEC services, considering both network design issues and usage scenarios.},

To handle complex interactions in CPS, trust and consensus among various stakeholders is a prime concern. In a similar direction, consensus algorithms in blockchain have evolved over the years that focus on building smart, robust, and secure CPS. Thus, it is imperative to understand the key components, functional characteristics, and architecture of different consensus algorithms used in CPS. Many consensus algorithms exist in the literature with a specified set of functionalities, performance, and computing services. Motivated from these facts, in this survey, we present a comprehensive analysis of existing state-of-the-art consensus mechanisms and highlight their strength and weaknesses in decentralized CPS applications. In the first part, we present the scope of the proposed survey and identify gaps in the existing surveys. Secondly, we present the review method and objectives of the proposed survey based on research questions that address the gaps in existing studies. Then, we present a solution taxonomy of decentralized consensus mechanisms for various CPS applications. Then, open issues and challenges are also discussed in deploying various consensus mechanisms in the CPS with their merits and demerits. The proposed survey will act as a road-map for blockchain developers and researchers to evaluate and design future consensus mechanisms, which helps to build an efficient CPS for industry 4.0 stakeholders.},

Additionally, traditional network security cannot be directly used in IoT networks due to its limitations on computational capabilities and storage capacities. Furthermore, authentication is the mainstay of the IoT network, as all components undergo an authentication process before establishing communication. Therefore, securing authentication is essential. In this paper, we have focused on IoT security particularly on their authentication mechanisms. Consequently, we highlighted enormous attacks and technical methods on the IoT authentication mechanism. Additionally, we discussed existing security verification techniques and evaluation schemes of IoT authentication. Furthermore, analysis against current existing protocols have been discussed in all parts and provided some recommendation.

The cybersecurity landscape deals with tremendous diverse event streams that exponentially increase the attack vectors. Event stream processing (ESP) methods appear to be solutions that leverage event streams to provide actionable insights and faster detection.

The integration of multi-dimensional networks consisting of space, air, and ground layers is expected to provide solutions in delivering cost-effective and ubiquitous Internet of things (IoT) services for billions of users and interconnected smart devices. Autonomous data collection, exchange, and processing across different network segments with minimal human interventions in space-air-ground IoT (SAG-IoT) can bring great convenience to consumers, however, it also suffers new attacks from intruders. Severe privacy invasion, reliability issues, and security breaches of SAG-IoT can hinder its wide deployment.

  abstract = {Trustworthy transmission is a beneficial step toward the success of the new era of telecommunication technologies and online social networks (OSNs). Many sensitive applications can benefit from OSNs, e.g., eHealth and medical services. However, OSNs have always been prey to Sybil attacks where numerous fake nodes are being generated and propagated in social networks to mimic like real nodes for the purpose of achieving malicious goals. Thus, for security reasons and for the sensitivity of data used in eHealth applications, such fake nodes have to be detected and deactivated immediately. The emerging field of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) promotes trust management (TM) among various IoMT devices to provide accurate and reliable communications, which is quite essential in critical diseases such as COVID-19. TM provides a secure platform to IoMT devices using different security protocols in the IoMT network. Generically, if a device is not comfortable to connect with additional devices in a network, the motive of the communication process is not succeeded and leads to disappointment for one device toward others. To handle these types of situations, a TM mechanism, named fuzzy-based TM mechanism for preventing Sybil attacks in the Internet of Medical Things (FTM-IoMT), is proposed. The FTM-IoMT provides TM for the users of eHealth systems using IoMT infrastructures. It is an intelligent mechanism to recognize Sybil or untrustworthy nodes in the system. The proposed mechanism helps IoMT nodes to collect authentic and credible information from their neighboring nodes as well as to neglect Sybil nodes. The trust value of a node is evaluated using fuzzy logic processing followed by the trust attributes, such as integrity, receptivity, and compatibility of a node. The FTM-IoMT provides a double evaluation check based on fuzzy logic processing and fuzzy filter. The proposed scheme shows superior results when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

The main advantages of this paradigm are core network offloading (and benefits therefrom) and low latency for delay-sensitive applications (e.g., automatic control). We have reviewed the state-of-the-art in the PEC paradigm and its applications to the IIoT domain, which have been enabled by the recent developments in 5G technology. We have classified and described three important research areas related to PEC-distributed artificial intelligence methods, energy efficiency, and cyber security. We have also identified the main open challenges that must be solved to have a scalable PEC-based IIoT network that operates efficiently under different conditions. By explaining the applications, challenges, and opportunities, our paper reinforces the perspective that the PEC paradigm is an extremely suitable and important deployment model for industrial communication networks, considering the modern trend toward private industrial 5G networks with local operations and flexible management.},

The steep growth and vast adoption of IoT devices reinforce the importance of sound and robust cybersecurity practices during the device development life cycles. IoT-related vulnerabilities, if successfully exploited can affect, not only the device itself but also the application field in which the IoT device operates. Evidently, identifying and addressing every single vulnerability are an arduous, if not impossible, task. Attack taxonomies can assist in classifying attacks and their corresponding vulnerabilities. Security countermeasures and best practices can then be leveraged to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities before they emerge into catastrophic attacks and ensure overall secure IoT operation. Therefore, in this article, we provide an attack taxonomy, which takes into consideration the different layers of the IoT stack, i.e., device, infrastructure, communication, and service, and each layer’s designated characteristics, which can be exploited by adversaries. Furthermore, using nine real-world cybersecurity incidents that had targeted IoT devices deployed in the consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors, we describe the IoT-related vulnerabilities, exploitation procedures, attacks, impacts, and potential mitigation mechanisms and protection strategies. These (and many other) incidents highlight the underlying security concerns of IoT systems and demonstrate the potential attack impacts of such connected ecosystems, while the proposed taxonomy provides a systematic procedure to categorize attacks based on the affected layer and corresponding impact.},

However, the high level of connectivity in today's Internet of vehicles (IoV) and the extreme reliance on the data collected from the smart transportation infrastructure widen the space of security vulnerabilities, making the IoV a potential target for cyberattacks. This article investigates novel sophisticated ways to exploit the IoV and launch intelligent attacks on road traffic services by creating persistent impact and reducing detection chances. This article models the processes of attack and defense as a cybersecurity Stackelberg game leading to optimal mixed strategies for both the attackers and the IoV defense system, where the latter optimally deploys the available security resources within the transportation infrastructure to minimize the impact of attacks and improve their detection. The game is of Bayesian type and considers several types of data corruption attacks that occur according to a probability distribution that we determine based on a rigorous risk assessment approach. The results show that our game model and solution allow us to reduce the impact of advanced persistent threats compared to a uniform defense design that is indifferent to attackers' strategies and types. The solution could be integrated into the design of IoV intrusion detection systems to increase their robustness.},

The privacy, reliability, and integrity of communications must be ensured so that actions can be appropriate, safe, accurate, and implemented promptly after receiving actionable information. In this work, we present a multi-tier methodology consisting of an authentication and trust-building/distribution framework designed to ensure the safety and validity of the information exchanged in the system. Blockchain protocols and Radio Frequency-Distinct Native Attributes (RF-DNA) combine to provide a hardware-software codesigned system for enhanced device identity and overall system trustworthiness. Our threat model accounts for counterfeiting, breakout fraud, and bad mouthing of one entity by others. Entity trust (e.g., IoT devices) depends on quality and level of participation, quality of messages, lifetime of a given entity in the system, and the number of known "bad" (non-consensus) messages sent by that entity. Based on this approach to trust, we are able to adjust trust upward and downward as a function of real-time and past behavior, providing other participants with a trust value upon which to judge information from and interactions with the given entity. This approach thereby reduces the potential for manipulation of an IoT system by a bad or byzantine actor.},

Still, it has the significant limitations of high complexity in algorithm design, requires more time consumption for processing, reduced maintenance, and does not require proper authentication verification. Therefore, the primary purpose of this work is to develop a new security model for smart city networks using a combination of methodologies. Here, the Collaborative Mutual Authentication (CMA) mechanism is used to validate the identity of users based on the private key, public key, session key, and generated hash function. In addition, the Meta-heuristic Genetic Algorithm – Random Forest (MGA-RF) technique is deployed to detect the attacks in the network, ensuring the security of the smart city. During an evaluation, the proposed authentication-based security mechanism’s performance is validated using various parameters, and the results are compared with the recent state-of-the-art models.},

However, maintaining cybersecurity is a major challenge in cloud-supported CV applications as it requires CVs and various transportation or non-transportation services to exchange data with the cloud via multiple wired and wireless communication networks. In this article, we review the cybersecurity requirements of cloud-supported CV applications, such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, accountability, and privacy. Our review also identifies the associated cybersecurity challenges that might impact cloud-supported CV applications and corresponding solutions to these challenges. In addition, we present future research opportunities to prevent and mitigate cybersecurity issues in cloud computing for CV-related applications.},

Then, the techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence will be more widely utilized for intelligent local data storage and processing generated by 6G applications, while innovative access network architecture based on the cloud-edge servers, such as the Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) will be adopted to improve the flexibility and openness for new service deployment and frequent network changes. On the other hand, new attack surfaces and vectors targeting local infrastructure and users will emerge along with the deployment of novel network architecture and techniques. Massive researchers have studied the potential security and privacy threats on the 6G network edge as well as the countermeasures. The three techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence have become a double-edged sword that can not only be synchronously utilized to develop defense countermeasures, but also become the targets of many new security and privacy threats. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of articles on the three techniques-related security threats and countermeasures on the 6G network edge. We explain how security and privacy can be destroyed by attacking one of the three technologies and how the three services support each other to realize efficient and achievable security protection. Moreover, the researches on the benefits and limitations of Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain for decentralized edge network systems in terms of security and privacy are also investigated. Additionally, we also analyze the existing challenges and future directions towards 6G.},

This article proposes a conditional generative adversarial net (CGAN)-based collaborative intrusion detection algorithm with blockchain-empowered distributed federated learning to solve the above problems. This study introduces long short-term memory (LSTM) into the CGAN training to improve the effect of generative networks. Based on the feature extraction ability of LSTM networks, the generated data with CGAN are used as augmented data and applied in the detection and classification of intrusion data. Distributed federated learning with differential privacy ensures data security and privacy and allows collaborative training of CGAN models using multiple distributed data sets. Blockchain stores and shares the training models to ensure security when the global model’s aggregation and updating. The proposed method has good generalization ability, which can greatly improve the detection of intrusion data.},

  abstract = {In Databases, the most prevalent cause of data breaches comes from insiders who misuse their account privileges. Due to the difficulty of discovering such breaches, an adaptive, accurate, and proactive database security strategy is required. Intrusion detection systems are utilized to detect, as fast as possible, user's account privilege misuse when a prevention mechanism has failed to address such breaches. In order to address the foremost deficiencies of intrusion detection systems, artificial immune systems are used to tackle these defects. The dynamic and more complex nature of cybersecurity, as well as the high false positive rate and high false negative percentage in current intrusion detection systems, are examples of such deficiency. In this paper, we propose an adaptable efficient database intrusion detection algorithm based on a combination of the Danger Theory model and the Negative Selection algorithm from artificial immune system mechanisms. Experimental results for the implementation of the proposed algorithm provide a self-learning mechanism for achieving high detection coverage with a low false positive rate by using the signature of previously detected intrusions as detectors for the future detection process. The proposed algorithm can enhance detecting insider threats and eliminate data breaches by protecting confidentiality, ensuring integrity, and maintaining availability. To give an integrated picture, a comprehensive and informative survey for the different research directions that are related to the proposed algorithm is performed.},

We have proposed a new method that integrates a decentralized, collaborative system to meet these challenges. This method efficiently allows Blockchain integration for vehicular network’s cyber security by dynamically creating communities to revoke malicious vehicles in real-time. This article presents analytical models of the system of real-time revoking certificates and examines our solution’s impact on two important types of attacks in V2X communications, Sybil and the faking position attacks. Our experiments using real V2X hardware demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of real-time revocation via vehicle communities. The results were obtained from consensus implementation in a vehicular network comprising three communicating vehicles and a single roadside unit. In parallel, simulations showed feasibility in large-scale communications. As a result, the exposure and detection times of our solution meet real-time requirements.},

  abstract = {Low-latency requirements of vehicular networks can be met by installing mobile edge hosts that implement mobile edge computing in the roadside units (RSUs). Adversaries can, however, compromise these RSUs and use them to launch cyber attacks. In this paper, we consider an adversary that selectively drops packets or selectively corrupts packets between the RSU and passing vehicles. Such strategies would lead to a higher number of re-transmissions and thereby increase the latency of the network, which in turn impacts critical delay-sensitive applications like collision avoidance, emergency vehicle warning, etc. We propose to use trust-based detection systems to detect such an adversary. Each vehicle transmits its uplink and downlink trust values about every RSU it has interacted with. These trust values are relayed to the RSU gateway, where the decision will be made, via the next RSU encountered by a vehicle. At regular intervals, the gateway aggregates the uplink and downlink trust values obtained from multiple vehicles. It compares them against their respective thresholds to classify the RSU as benign or malicious. We also consider the presence of malicious vehicles trying to deceive the detection system by reporting false trust values. A detection mechanism is proposed to detect such vehicles. Simulation results generated using MATLAB are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed detection mechanisms and the impact of the adversary's parameters on the detection systems.},

As the deployment of large-scale sensing nodes for reporting road conditions is too expensive, the crowdsourcing method or reporting by sensors in vehicles themselves will be easier to deploy and more practical. However, those participant sensing methods impose some difficulties, such as fake information, reporter misbehavior, and timeliness. Thus, we propose a tri-blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles system, called TriBoDeS, to facilitate real-time information detection and sharing. It is designed to guarantee concurrency and security to dynamically store, manage, and share information uploaded by vehicles with great efficiency. Such information will be announced on the blockchain under the autonomous identification of vehicles in low-trust conditions. In order to ensure the software’s security, TriBoDeS can monitor the software’s state, detect identified malicious activities, and respond accordingly. To ensure data security, a role-based management mechanism is introduced to achieve fine-grained control over permissions, and confidence rules are established to guarantee the authenticity of the data. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme, we evaluate its performance (e.g., computing and communication overheads) and security (e.g., resiliency against common attacks) over a consortium blockchain. The experimental results demonstrate that, under the conditions of a sufficient number of vehicles, the TriBoDeS system is capable of real-time information sharing while ensuring the security of user information. Compared to conventional single-chain systems, the TriBoDeS system achieves a 2.75-time improvement in efficiency.},

Moreover, the lack of trust among heterogeneous, massive sets of participants in V2X networks at present may hamper those activities with frequent privacy violations and other irreversible consequences. Hence, the blockchains are applied to assure the accountability and integrity among network participants. On the other hand, the integrated edge layer today consists of Macro BS (MBSs), Small BS (SBSs), Road Side Units (RSUs), and 5G Radio Access Networks (RANs) which are geo-distributed and installed with independent storage facilities. As a result, revolutionary blockchain platforms can be easily accommodated to 5G Mutiaccess Edge Computing (MEC). This allows to apply fast and efficient consensus mechanism for block verification while preventing backhaul congestion by offloading computation at the cloud. Therefore, efficient New Radio (NR) access technology, core network capabilities, and edge-cloud services are needed to reach the full convergence of V2X networks while blockchain can be used to solve major related security vulnerabilities ranging from data privacy leakage, cyber-attacks, and access control to security breaches leading to extremely advanced data theft.

As a consequence, preserving the data privacy and security of these applications is of utmost importance. In this respect, a modelling technique for identifying potential data privacy threats and specifying countermeasures to mitigate the related vulnerabilities in such AI-based systems plays a significant role in preserving and securing personal data. Various threat modelling techniques have been proposed such as STRIDE, LINDDUN, and PASTA but none of them is sufficient to model the data privacy threats in autonomous systems. Furthermore, they are not designed to model compliance with data protection legislation like the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is fundamental to protecting data owners’ privacy as well as to preventing personal data from potential privacy-related attacks. In this article, we survey the existing threat modelling techniques for data privacy threats in autonomous systems and then analyse such techniques from the viewpoint of GDPR compliance. Following the analysis, We employ STRIDE and LINDDUN in autonomous cars, a specific use-case of autonomous systems, to scrutinise the challenges and gaps of the existing techniques when modelling data privacy threats. Prospective research directions for refining data privacy threats & GDPR-compliance modelling techniques for autonomous systems are also presented.},

Blockchains, which are tamper-proof, can be used to store electronic data securely, preserving the privacy of individuals and devices. However, most of the consumer smart devices are resource-constrained, so the computational overhead of blockchain based schemes should not be ignored. Furthermore, the dynamic change of consumer smart devices in real-world scenarios is also an open issue. In this paper, a revocable and lightweight access control scheme (ReLAC) is proposed to realize deduplication and dynamic user revocation for smart consumer electronics/devices using blockchain. To protect the privacy of consumers and devices in the access matrix, the partially hidden policy is adopted in the proposed scheme. Note that, no detailed attribute values of the consumers or the devices are included in the ciphertext transmission. Finally, outsourced decryption is applied to solve the resource-constrained problem of smart consumer electronics/devices. The proposed scheme is proved to be s-IND-CPA secure in the standard model if there exists no one can crackle the decisional q-BDHE assumption. The performance analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and computational efficiency for the application in consumer electronic systems.},

In our case, the frequent pattern learning algorithm is used to create a database corresponding to the normal operation of the system, then, this database is fed into an attack detection algorithm in order to alert the user whenever an attack is occurring. The extensive simulations prove that our attack detection approach is able to detect attacks with a great accuracy and that this methodology could work even for large scale systems.},

Vulnerabilities in CAVs can lead to breakdowns in the transportation system and compromise safety (e.g., causing crashes), performance (e.g., increasing congestion and reducing capacity), and fairness (e.g., vehicles fooling traffic signals). This paper presents our perspective on CATS cybersecurity via surveying recent pertinent studies focusing on the transportation system level, ranging from individual and multiple vehicles to the traffic network (including infrastructure). It also highlights threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) tools and evaluation platforms, particularly for analyzing the CATS cybersecurity problem.

This data should include rescue orders, details on the state of the roadways, and data on prior rescue missions. This will guarantee that you are able to drive safely and effectively respond. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can be used to conduct instant recovery services in places that are destructed and assist in sharing data for ground Vehicular networks, can be utilised when connectivity investments are damaged as a consequence of climate change. UAVs can help share data for field Iot environments and can conduct recovery services in areas that have been damaged. However, in a tragedy scenario involving UAV-assisted IoV, there are possible safety threats on intelligence sharing among machines and UAVs. These threats are the outcome of an unreliable distributed environment, unreliable improper behavior tracing, and minimal information. These issues could compromise the integrity of shared data. The interconnection of the relevant vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) makes these dangers possible. In this article, we create a lightweight vehicular blockchain-enabled secure (LVBS) data exchange architecture for the Automotive Internet of Things that is helped by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist in hurricane relief. The concerns which have been voiced will be addressed more effectively as a result of this. To begin, we will discuss the new UAV and smart contracts collaboration high - altitude system architectures that we have developed for usage in places that have been affected by natural disasters. A resource consensus method is developed for the lighter vehicular ecosystem in the second step of our project. This not only makes it possible for us to track and record data exchanges in a manner that is both safe and immutable, but it also helps us arrive at a majority more quickly while ensuring that its degree of safety is not compromised. In the end, comprehensive models are tested, which demonstrate that LVBS has the ability to effectively increase the safety of the consensual phase and stimulate the data exchange of a great quality. This is shown by the fact that LVBS has been shown to have this capacity.},

This system has revolutionized the medical architecture to evolve unprecedented opportunities in using the technologies of next-generation networks, including services, control, and signaling, to effectively improve content delivery to individuals and organizations. However, it is a highly complex matter to distribute confidential data over a public network because data privacy and device security are at risk. As a result, a cloud-based healthcare application is introduced that integrates the computation capabilities of ubiquitous computing to provide extensive communications over dedicated Internet access in order to store health records. To manage access control mechanisms and process sensitive data without extensive computation, the existing cloud-centric systems access remote servers via dedicated networks. Based on a centralized architecture, a dedicated network uses different application domains to deliver information to the healthcare industry. Unfortunately, computation complexity greatly deteriorates the performance of peer-to-peer (P2P) communications. Thus, this paper presents a cloud-assisted decentralized privacy preserving framework (CA-DPPF) using blockchain and key agreement (KA) mechanisms to achieve secure data storage and privacy. The detailed security analysis proves that the proposed scheme fulfills the desired security properties of healthcare supply chain management (H-SCM) such as conditional traceability, data immutability, and data integrity. Overall, exploratory analysis shows that CA-DPPF guarantees better transaction efficiencies such as less latency and more throughput in order to improve the service utilization factor.},

  abstract  = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been wildly used in various environments to actively detect internal and external attacks with high accuracy. Unfortunately, the traditional IDSs cannot distinguish new or unknown attacks from abnormal behaviors effectively, and that makes them infeasible to protect the emerging dynamic open information systems. Subsequently, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are introduced into IDSs to support the recognization of unexplored malicious behaviors. However, most of the existing AI-driven IDSs are not able to be directly applied to intelligent swarm scenarios, which are typically employed to aggregate heterogeneous or homogeneous elements (e.g., autonomous vehicles, drones) to solve complex problems that the individual members cannot deal with, due to the characteristics of mobility and complexity of intelligent elements. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lightweight and efficient distributed cooperative IDS (DCIDS) for intelligent swarms. On one hand, to efficiently detect the malicious behaviors among swarm elements, we design a collaborative detection model which utilizes multi-dimension features including the swarm elements' position, storage-computing resource consuming levels, network traffics, et al. On the other hand, to predict the movement trends and detect attacks of resource-limited swarm elements, we construct a concrete DCIDS scheme by employing the Kalyan Filter algorithm and Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) algorithm. Furthermore, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DCIDS scheme outperforms the previous IDS schemes on attack detection/classification accuracy and efficiency in intelligent swarm environments and also achieves an accuracy of 98.00%.},

As such, cloud-assisted CAVs would be exposed to a large amount of dynamic information (such as speed, location, vehicle ID, travel routes, passengers' personal information, bank details and so on). Moreover, CAVs have a reasonably long lifetime due to which the associated vehicular technologies in CAVs age and it is possible that vulnerabilities can be exploited to inflict harm.

In this paper, a type of adversary model based on attack effects, namely, disturbance attack, was established. A numerical simulation platform for CAVs cyberattack experiment was built to quantitatively analyze the impacts of CAVs cyberattacks on traffic. 9 measurement indicators were constructed based on traffic safety indicators and traffic flow parameters for the characteristic impacts of various attacks. Using the cyberattack experiment simulation platform to generate attack feature datasets, A cyberattack detection model of CAVs on the basis of nonlinear Support Vector Machine was established. The model showed a sound classification performance, with a detection rate of more than 95% within 3s of the attack.

Characterized by the orbital motion patterns and harsh space environments, the LEO satellite edge computing faces unique security challenges in terms of the secure collaboration of multiple satellites and the intellectual property protection of models. Under the unique space environment and security demands, we propose a secure satellite edge computing framework in this paper. By taking a remote electricity line outage identification use case as an example, our framework first achieves the secure delegation of the line outage identification task among multiple satellites, which is realized through a secure query $(\mathsf {SQuery})$ scheme to check the availability of the target time slot. Meanwhile, we also design a SHE-enabled secure inner-product encryption ($\mathsf {SSIPE}$) protocol, to achieve the secure multinomial logistic regression (MLR) based line outage identification on-orbit. To reduce the complexity brought by the computationally intensive homomorphic multiplication between two ciphertexts, we further grasp the idea and design a “divide-and-conquer” based secure query ($\mathsf {DSQuery}$) scheme, which converts this homomorphic multiplication operation between ciphertexts into the homomorphic addition operation. As far as we know, this is the first scheme investigating the secure task delegation among different satellites on-orbit. Besides, detailed security analyses are performed to demonstrate the security properties of confidentiality and authentication. In performance evaluations, we test and compare the computational and communication overhead of our scheme and other straightforward schemes. Simulation results show that the $\mathsf {DSQuery}$ scheme greatly reduces the computational cost, which saves the stringent on-orbit computation resources of LEO satellites.},

  abstract   = {To reduce network intrusion detection latency in a high volume of data traffic, on-device detection with neuron pruning has been widely adopted by eliminating ineffective connections from a densely connected neural network. However, neuron pruning has a serious problem called output separation in which some parts of neurons can easily be pruned in the middle and become isolated from the rest of the network. To this end, we introduce a solution called the Conservation of Output Links (COOL) pruning method that iteratively preserves a set of effective connections to avoid neuron isolation. We first evaluate COOL on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets as well as programmable networking devices such as P4-supported switches. The experimental results show that COOL outperforms existing methods in terms of both detection time and classification accuracy, especially in extremely sparse networks. Compared to three representative pruning methods, our COOL-based classification model performs at least 25% more accurately with the upper bound for the pruning probability. To further display the effectiveness of COOL-based intrusion detection, we formulate a novel detection time minimization problem by assigning suitable detection models for switches in IoT under performance requirements and resource limitations. The experimental results demonstrate that our COOL algorithm is particularly useful for delay-critical and high-traffic applications.},

Blockchain (BC) based federated learning (FL) facilities a highly secure and trustless collaborative learning framework; however, it could be inefficient for the time-sensitive services of the Internet of vehicles (IoV). In this regard, this study investigates information dissemination delay in BC-based FL for IoV using a small world network based peer selection strategy. Additionally, we also incorporate IoV specific informed decision for peer selection to facilitate even faster dissemination of information in the network and make blockchain based system efficient. Network topology of vehicles is represented using a graph approach and based on that the information dissemination delay is formulated. The delay is compared between scenarios when peer selection strategy uses informed decision and that does not use informed decision. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through the graph analysis which demonstrates that the inclusion of informed decision reduces the information dissemination delay remarkably.},

  abstract   = {Aiming at the existing problems of insufficient security and poor scalability of existing blockchain data management solutions for the Internet of Vehicles, we use IPFS distributed technology to design a data privacy protection method for the Internet of Vehicles based on zero-knowledge proof. First, we use the Schnorr identity authentication protocol, a classic non-interactive zero-knowledge proof scheme, to complete the authentication and authorization of vehicles by RSU under the premise of protecting vehicle privacy. Secondly, we store encrypted data on IPFS-based edge distributed servers, and use Hyperledger Fabric to store authentication records and data indexes, which solves the problem of insufficient blockchain scalability. Finally, in order to improve the controllability and security of the data, we use the proxy re-encryption mechanism to manage the Symmetric-key of the data, and let RSU act as a proxy to perform re-encryption. Compared with the existing schemes, the proposed scheme reduces the communication overhead of the vehicle identity authentication phase, which is only 1728 bits. And while improving the scalability of the blockchain, it also enhances the privacy protection of the data of the Internet of Vehicles.},

  abstract   = {By enabling connectivity and collaboration among moving vehicles, Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) is expected to bring dramatically improved road safety and traffic efficiency. With limited onboard resources and real-time operational constraints, achieving these goals through handling time-sensitive IoV services and tasks inevitably relies on rapid and reliable collaboration among moving vehicles. Due to safety-related considerations, such collaboration always requires complex evaluation of potential collaborative vehicles, resulting in increased latency in time-sensitive IoV task handling. To achieve rapid and reliable IoV collaboration, a comprehensive concept of trust among neighbouring vehicles is first conceptualized in this paper to maximize Quality of Experience (QoE) by expediting the IoV collaborator selection as well as overall task handling. Specifically, we propose a new concept of indirect trust and the related Rapid and Reliable Trust Evaluation (RTE) mechanism by enabling trust transfer from reliable third parties to reduce the trust evaluation latency of potential collaborative peers. Furthermore, capability trust and direct experiential trust are introduced as two additional evaluation factors in RTE to assess the capability and reliability of collaborators and to reduce task computation time. Lastly, the different factors of the proposed trust, i.e., indirect trust, direct experiential trust and capability trust, are integrated and adaptively utilized at different stages of IoV collaboration by a proposed adaptive trust factor aggregation scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RTE mechanism achieves higher QoE with reduced task completion latency by swiftly selecting the optimal IoV collaborator compared to existing trust evaluation mechanisms.},

In addition, the current selective disclosure schemes based on merkle tree still require large costs when there are many data items. To solve these problems, a blockchain-based framework for sharing cars’ location information applicable to the online car hailing industry is proposed in this paper, enabling the sharing of cars’ location information while protecting passengers’ privacy through selective disclosure. The combination of homomorphic encryption and probabilistic verification enables a faster batch data verification compared to other blockchain-based data sharing schemes, as well as ensures the authenticity of the data uploaded to the blockchain. The experimental results show that the proposed selective disclosure mechanism based on hash exclusive or tree has lower costs than the baseline for cases with many data items. Moreover, the proposed framework meets both security and feasibility requirements. Specifically speaking, under the constraint of 128-bits security level, the costs of time and space on the location information during one drive are at microsecond level and kilobyte level, respectively. Finally, the scheme is suitable for scenarios with higher throughput.},

  abstract   = {Wearable IoT devices are easily compromised by malware due to their security vulnerabilities. The bots infected by malware may continue to infect healthy neighbor devices through wireless communication technology in mobile wearable IoT networks (WIoT). All bots form a botnet which eventually leads to a series of malicious attacks. Therefore, it’s necessary to predict the dynamic malware propagation path between wearable devices, which can help provide target immunization measures on devices to prevent the formation of botnets. In this paper, we capture the local interaction and spatial-temporal propagation behavior of malware utilizing the individual-based cellular automata (CA) model. Firstly, taking into account the mobility of walking users carrying wearable devices in the actual WIoT, we present a human mobility model called Gauss-Markov Truncated Levy Walk (GM-TLW) to describe the movement patterns of mobile users. Secondly, based on the moving coordinates of all wearable devices obtained from the GM-TLW mobility model, we leverage the improved CA propagation model to study the time evolution of the number of bots and the spreading spatial distribution of malware. We compare our propagation model with the differential equation model and traditional CA model, and analyze the impact of various parameters on the dynamics of botnet formation using numerical simulations. Lastly, detailed simulation results show that the GM-TLW model is more suitable for realistic human mobility scenarios. In addition, the proposed CA-based model is more precise than the differential equation model to modeling the malware propagation and provides a basis for defenders to adopt the optimal malware control strategies.},

IoV technology helps vehicles interact and exchange information between public networks and the surrounding environment, which reduces road congestion. In order to protect the information from attack and to provide efficient data transmission, this paper proposes secure federated learning for a vehicular cyber-physical system using an Inter-polated public key and private key-ROTation (IPP-ROT)-based Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Fed Buff: Federated Learning with Buffered Asynchronous Aggregation based Log Sigmoid Multi-Layer Perceptron (FB-FL-BAA-LSMLP) techniques. Initially, the vehicles are registered with a cloud server by generating keys and cipher text using ECC and IPP-ROT algorithms. After that, vehicle parameters are sensed by the server. As a large number of vehicles cross the Road Side Units (RSU), hashing is performed to authenticate the vehicle crossing RSUs using the Digit Folding-based Hash of Variable Length (DF-HAVAL) algorithm to avoid data collisions and uneven delays. Further, the data classification performed using FB-FL-BAA-LSMLP, which classifies data, and attacked data will be detected. At last, the performance of the proposed method is verified by comparing it with the existing techniques, and the results show better performance than the other methods.},

Many schemes are proposed to solve the secure issues, in which vehicular on-board units (OBUs) or road side units (RSUs) preloaded entire vehicular real identities, which are used for authentication. However, OBUs or RSUs may be compromised, in other word, these existing schemes have their limitations to preserve vehicular identity privacy. Furthermore, in some schemes, the confidentiality of vehicular messages is not considered, clear-text vehicular messages may also disclose vehicular identity privacy. Therefore, we propose a secure and lightweight vehicular privacy preservation scheme for IoVs, in which fog servers use partial vehicular identity information to authenticate their legitimacy so as not to disclose vehicular identity privacy; lightweight and outsourcing decrypting attribute-based encryption methods are employed to achieve access control on sensitive vehicular messages and reduce resource-limited vehicular computation costs; moreover, an innovative conditional identity privacy preservation method is proposed to reveal the real identity of malicious vehicles without disclosing the real identity of honest vehicles even if there are some compromised fog servers or malicious vehicles. Experiments show our scheme is efficient.},

  abstract   = {With the emergence of new and exciting wireless technologies and capabilities, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (uavs) and the services they allow, stand to be a major influencer in our daily lives. Unfortunately, they are also prone to a plethora of security issues. Existing studies propose both prevention and identification schemes for various routing attacks. They do not, however, preclude future malicious attempts. Hence, in this work we identify the specific uav that is compromising the network, with the specific purpose of flushing it out. The proposed solution combines secret sharing and cheating identification schemes with multi-path routing protocols, to deterministically pinpoint the compromised node that is cheating the uav flock. It assures a quiet identification of the adversary creating new opportunities for its attack, even when facing a sophisticated adversary that selectively modifies data messages or re-routes them in within the network. We took special care to allow for applicability in existing networks by adhering to two basic principles: only using pre-existing standard routing protocols and not relying on a centralized or trusted third party node such as a base station. All information must be gleaned by each node using only primitives which already exist in the underlying communication protocols. We provide a rigorous mathematical proof of the cost bounds, and run simulations to prove feasibility. Moreover, the simulations show a 100% detection rate and message delivery rate. The communication overhead varies, on average, between 0.4∙106-0.8∙106 bytes, depending on various parameters such as the network size and the reception rate of network nodes. The time required varies between 0.2-0.4 seconds, depending mainly on the network size.},

The proliferation of connected devices and machines brings forth a range of security concerns, including data tampering and unauthorized access. Establishing confidential and trustworthy communication between these devices becomes particularly difficult as they rely on the open channel of the Internet. Numerous established security measures, such as antivirus software, access control systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), have been identified in the literature as facing issues like centralized vulnerabilities, latency challenges, reliability issues, and single points of failure. As technology advances rapidly, the convergence of emerging technologies holds immense potential to revolutionize industrial automation. Among these promising technologies, blockchain and 6G stand out for their immense potential. With its decentralized and tamper-proof nature, blockchain has disrupted various sectors, while 6G offers unprecedented connectivity and lightning-fast data transfer speeds. Motivated by these developments, this paper explores the potential impact of integrating blockchain technology with 6G in industrial automation, paving the way for the future of smart factories and intelligent supply chains.

According to Reuters, global car makers plan to invest over half a billion in more efficient and intelligent EVs and batteries. However, there are several challenges in EV mass production, including cybersecurity. Due to the cyber-physical nature of EVs and charging stations, their security and trustworthiness are ongoing challenges. In this study, we identify gaps in the security profiling of EVs and categorize them into five components: 1) charging station security, 2) information privacy, 3) software security, 4) connected vehicle security, and 5) autonomous driving security. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities, threats, challenges and attacks for different EV security aspects, along with their possible surface/subsurface and countermeasures. We develop a comprehensive security risk assessment framework by first using EV security profiles and mapping identified vulnerabilities to a well-known threat model, STRIDE. Then, we classify the risk levels associated with each vulnerability by setting ground criteria for the impact and likelihood of the threats. Finally, we validate our risk assessment framework by applying the same criteria to eight real-world EV attack scenarios. As a result, researchers can adapt the proposed risk assessment framework to discover threats and assess their risks in EVs and charging station ecosystems.},

Existing authentication methods suffer from complicated certificate management and key escrow problems. Moreover, many authentication mechanisms cannot resist common security attacks and have high computational overhead and communication costs. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain-based certificate-free cross-domain authentication mechanism for Industrial Internet. By establishing an Ethereum consortium blockchain as the trusted cornerstone among different regions, industrial enterprises in each region generate the user’s private key with the key generation center in the region, thus avoiding the key escrow problem. This consortium blockchain adopts the proof of authority consensus mechanism for scalability and throughput. Industrial enterprises in different regions invoke smart contracts and query other industrial enterprises for mutual authentication and key negotiation. SVO logic proves the proposed scheme achieves the intended authentication goal, and the automated formal verification tool Scyther proves the scheme’s security. In addition, compared with seven related schemes in the last three years, the experimental results show that the proposed scheme has low communication overhead and computational cost in the authentication key negotiation phase. The experiments on the Ethereum consortium blockchain built by Raspberry Pi prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Finally, the comparative analysis of common security properties proves the reliability of the scheme.},
