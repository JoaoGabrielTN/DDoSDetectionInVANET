  abstract   = {Wireless radio frequency (RF) jamming, both intentional and unintentional, poses a serious threat for wireless networks and wireless communications in general. Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) are a subset of the wireless networks that incorporate modern safety-critical applications, that are vulnerable to jamming attacks. To preserve the secure communication and to increase its robustness against that type of attacks, an accurate detection scheme must be adopted. In this paper we present a jamming detection approach for wireless vehicular networks that leverages the use of unsupervised machine learning. The proposed method, utilizes a new metric, that is the variations of the relative speed between the jammer and the receiver, along with parameters that can be obtained from the on-board wireless communication devices at the receiver vehicle. Through unsupervised learning with clustering, we are able to differentiate intentional from unintentional jamming as well as identify the unique characteristics of each jamming attack. The proposed method is applied to three different real-life scenarios with extensive simulations being presented.},

  abstract   = {Integrated Intelligent Transportation System (IITS) is built by the emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and the employment of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the transportation field for improving traffic efficiency, avoiding accidents, and improving the safety experience in driving. Large-scale networks, dynamic topology structure, uneven nodes distribution, and unlimited mobility are the characteristics of IITS. It increased the risk of a variety of attacks related to authentication, credentials, availability, privacy, routing, and legitimacy of data. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attack plays a vital role in impairing Road Side Units (RSU) of IITS and is capable of evading classical data filtering methods. In this paper, a novel DDoS flooding attack detection method is proposed for ensuring the security of IITS by employing reinforcement learning. The proposed framework is implemented by addressing the security requirements of ITS and overcoming the flaws of existing detection methods in advanced vehicular systems. In addition, the Q learning algorithm is designed along with the framework. Other attacks, in addition to DDoS flooding attacks, should be mitigated in the future to ensure a completely secure connection.},

  abstract   = {The development of the intelligent transport space (ITS) comes with the challenge of securing transportation data. As the vehicular network is highly dynamic, the network architecture is susceptible to distributed malicious attacks irrespective of the emergence and integration of enabling technologies. A Software Defined Network (SDN) based VANET is an improvement over the traditional VANET and may be susceptible to attacks as a result of its centralized structure, resulting in dangerous circumstances. SDN-based VANET security for 5G deployments is essential and calls for integrating artificial intelligence tools for threat detection. An intrusion detection system was suggested in this work to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in the vehicular space. The proposed solution uses the Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) exhaustive parameter search technique and the Radial Basis Function Kernel of the Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) algorithm. The performance of other ML algorithms implemented was compared using key performance metrics. Experimental simulations to validate the proposed framework’s efficacy against DDoS intrusion show that the proposed scheme demonstrated an overall accuracy of 99.40% and a mean absolute error of 0.006.},

  abstract   = {The aim of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is to provide drivers and passengers with various applications and services for comfortable transportation by supporting traffic efficiency and safety. However, the traditional VANETs face various technical challenges in meeting the basic requirements of intelligent transportation systems such as scalability, flexibility and management due to the ever-increasing number of intelligent vehicles. With its flexible, programmable, scalable network structure, Software Defined Networks (SDNs) are candidates for providing solutions to the problems experienced. The architecture, which was created by adapting the SDN paradigm to the traditional VANET is simply called SD-VANET. This new architecture allows easy scaling of the network and flexible network management. Despite the advantages of SD-VANET architecture, it is also vulnerable to cyberattack threats such as Distributed Denial Of Service (DDoS). In this study, different machine learning classifiers were used to detect DDoS attacks targeting SD-VANETs. First, a dataset containing features of normal network traffic and DDoS attack network traffic was obtained from an experimentally created SD-VANET topology. Then the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) feature selection algorithm was used to select the most distinctive features of the dataset. Machine learning classifiers were trained and tested with both original and feature selection applied datasets. Moreover, in the learning phase, hyperparameter optimization for the classifiers was applied using the Bayesian optimization method. According to the experimental results, the highest accuracy score obtained was 99.35% with MRMR feature selection and Bayesian optimization-based decision tree classifier. The results demonstrate that the MRMR feature selection and Bayesian optimization-based classifier approach have been successful for the detection of DDoS attacks on SD-VANETs.},
