  abstract       = {Modern vehicle communication development is a continuous process in which cutting-edge security systems are required. Security is a main problem in the Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET). Malicious node detection is one of the critical issues found in the VANET environment, with the ability to communicate and enhance the mechanism to enlarge the field. The vehicles are attacked by malicious nodes, especially DDoS attack detection. Several solutions are presented to overcome the issue, but none are solved in a real-time scenario using machine learning. During DDoS attacks, multiple vehicles are used in the attack as a flood on the targeted vehicle, so communication packets are not received, and replies to requests do not correspond in this regard. In this research, we selected the problem of malicious node detection and proposed a real-time malicious node detection system using machine learning. We proposed a distributed multi-layer classifier and evaluated the results using OMNET++ and SUMO with machine learning classification using GBT, LR, MLPC, RF, and SVM models. The group of normal vehicles and attacking vehicles dataset is considered to apply the proposed model. The simulation results effectively enhance the attack classification with an accuracy of 99%. Under LR and SVM, the system achieved 94 and 97%, respectively. The RF and GBT achieved better performance with 98% and 97% accuracy values, respectively. Since we have adopted Amazon Web Services, the network&rsquo;s performance has improved because training and testing time do not increase when we include more nodes in the network.},

  abstract       = {Vehicle malfunctions have a direct impact on both human and road safety, making vehicle network security an important and critical challenge. Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have grown to be indispensable in recent years for enabling intelligent transport systems, guaranteeing traffic safety, and averting collisions. However, because of numerous types of assaults, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Denial of Service (DoS), VANETs have significant difficulties. A powerful Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) is required to overcome these security issues. This research presents an innovative method for creating an AI-based NIDS that uses Deep Learning methods. The suggested model specifically incorporates the Self Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (SA-BiLSTM) for classification and the Cascaded Convolution Neural Network (CCNN) for learning high-level features. The Multi-variant Gradient-Based Optimization algorithm (MV-GBO) is applied to improve CCNN and SA-BiLSTM further to enhance the model&rsquo;s performance. Additionally, information gained using MV-GBO-based feature extraction is employed to enhance feature learning. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on reliable datasets such as KDD-CUP99, ToN-IoT, and VeReMi, which are utilized on the MATLAB platform. The proposed model achieved 99% accuracy on all the datasets.},

  abstract   = {The dynamic nature of the vehicular space exposes it to distributed malicious attacks irrespective of the integration of enabling technologies. The software-defined network (SDN) represents one of these enabling technologies, providing an integrated improvement over the traditional vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). Due to the centralized characteristics of SDN, they are vulnerable to attacks that may result in life-threatening situations. Securing SDN-based VANETs is vital and requires incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Hence, this work proposed an intrusion detection model (IDM) to identify Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in the vehicular space. The proposed solution employs the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and an exhaustive parameter search technique called grid search cross-validation (GSCV). In this framework, the proposed architecture can be deployed on the onboard units (OBUs) of each vehicle, which receive the vehicular data and run intrusion detection tasks to classify a message sequence as a DDoS attack or benign. The performance of the proposed algorithm compared to other ML algorithms using key performance metrics. The proposed framework is validated through experimental simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting DDoS intrusion. Using the GridSearchCV, optimal values of the RBF-SVM kernel parameters “C” and “gamma”  $(\gamma)$  of 100 and 0.1, respectively, gave the optimal performance. The proposed scheme showed an overall accuracy of 99.33%, a detection rate of 99.22%, and an average squared error of 0.007, outperforming existing benchmarks.},

One of the most dangerous forms of attack that threaten vehicular communication systems are distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and increasing the security of VANETs against such attacks is a topic that a large number of researchers are now considering, were to provide highly effective security capabilities, machine learning (ML) techniques were applied. NSL-KDD or KDD-CUP99 datasets form the basis for the greater part of the current research. Attacks on these datasets were outdated. Therefore, we used a new dataset generated by OMNeT++, Veins, and Sumo. Two different types of attacks were conducted during this simulation, and the XGBoost classifier was used to evaluate and predict MDS systems. The median F1-score for this XGBoost classifier was 99%, which represented a clear advantage over another ML method, where we used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to class balance the datasets.},

  abstract   = {Security assurance in Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) is a crucial and challenging task due to the open-access medium. One great threat to VANETs is Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack because the target of this attack is to prevent authorized nodes from accessing the services. To provide high availability of VANETs, a scalable, reliable and robust network intrusion detection system should be developed to efficiently mitigate DDoS. However, big data from VANETs poses serious challenges to DDoS attack detection since the detection system require scalable methods to capture, store and process the big data. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a distributed DDoS network intrusion detection system based on big data technology. The proposed detection system consists of two main components: real-time network traffic collection module and network traffic detection module. To build our proposed system, we use Spark to speed up data processing and use HDFS to store massive suspicious attacks. In the network collection module, micro-batch data processing model is used to improve the real-time performance of traffic feature collection. In the traffic detection module, the classification algorithm based on Random Forest (RF) is adopted. In order to evaluate the accuracy of detection, the algorithm was evaluated and compared in the datasets, containing NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. The experimental results show that the proposed detection algorithm reached the accuracy rate of 99.95% and 98.75%, and the false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.05% and 1.08%, respectively, in two datasets.},

Existing DDoS detection systems in vehicular networks use a variety of Machine Learning (ML) methods. These techniques claim to be relevant and successful in attack detection in vehicular networks. The ML-based solutions use DDoS dynamics like adaptive traffic, heterogeneity, and packet features etc. As a result, a question arises whether these ML-based techniques are capable of handling novel security threats. In this paper, we use BayesNet technique on different datasets to test its performance and analyse the results to validate its usage for protecting against novel network security threats. BayesNet helps in decision making by improving data management and analysis. We use two datasets: simulation-based dataset and CIC-DDoS-2019 dataset. The CIC-DDoS-2019 dataset has 12 subsets and we use SYN, UDPLag and Portmap data subset. These datasets contain three types of DDoS attacks, i.e., SYN-flood attack, UDPLag attack, and Portmap attack. We test BayesNet to see the performance of the algorithm in detecting the mentioned forms of DDoS. We consider the parameters of accuracy, True Positive Rate (TPR), and False Positive Rate (FPR) for performance evaluation. In all the results, we observe that accuracy is always higher than 90%. TPR is very high, i.e. weighted TPR is 0.99 and wighted FPR of all tests is 0.076 that is quiet low. All these results prove that BayesNet ML technique is capable of detecting DDoS attack forms significantly.},

These detection & prevention techniques are implemented in different environments including vehicular network environments and computer network environments. Three different datasets connected to heterogeneous environments are adopted for experimentation. The first dataset is the NSL-KDD dataset based on the traffic of the computer network.

Results show that an accuracy of more than 99.9% is obtained from the simulation-based vehicular dataset. This is the highest accuracy rate among the three datasets and it is obtained within a very short period of time i.e., 0.5 seconds.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most popular attack types aiming at the availability of system. We consider the timely detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks to RSU in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). A novel framework for detecting and mitigating low-rate DDoS attacks in ITS based on nonparametric statistical anomaly detection is proposed. Dealing with low-rate DDoS attacks is challenging since they can bypass traditional data filtering techniques while threatening the RSU availability due to their highly distributed nature. Extensive simulation results are presented for a real road scenario with the help of the SUMO traffic simulation software. The results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms two parametric methods for timely detection based on the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) test, as well as the traditional data filtering approach in terms of average detection delay and false alarm rate.},

  abstract   = {Wireless radio frequency (RF) jamming, both intentional and unintentional, poses a serious threat for wireless networks and wireless communications in general. Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) are a subset of the wireless networks that incorporate modern safety-critical applications, that are vulnerable to jamming attacks. To preserve the secure communication and to increase its robustness against that type of attacks, an accurate detection scheme must be adopted. In this paper we present a jamming detection approach for wireless vehicular networks that leverages the use of unsupervised machine learning. The proposed method, utilizes a new metric, that is the variations of the relative speed between the jammer and the receiver, along with parameters that can be obtained from the on-board wireless communication devices at the receiver vehicle. Through unsupervised learning with clustering, we are able to differentiate intentional from unintentional jamming as well as identify the unique characteristics of each jamming attack. The proposed method is applied to three different real-life scenarios with extensive simulations being presented.},

  abstract   = {Integrated Intelligent Transportation System (IITS) is built by the emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and the employment of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the transportation field for improving traffic efficiency, avoiding accidents, and improving the safety experience in driving. Large-scale networks, dynamic topology structure, uneven nodes distribution, and unlimited mobility are the characteristics of IITS. It increased the risk of a variety of attacks related to authentication, credentials, availability, privacy, routing, and legitimacy of data. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attack plays a vital role in impairing Road Side Units (RSU) of IITS and is capable of evading classical data filtering methods. In this paper, a novel DDoS flooding attack detection method is proposed for ensuring the security of IITS by employing reinforcement learning. The proposed framework is implemented by addressing the security requirements of ITS and overcoming the flaws of existing detection methods in advanced vehicular systems. In addition, the Q learning algorithm is designed along with the framework. Other attacks, in addition to DDoS flooding attacks, should be mitigated in the future to ensure a completely secure connection.},

  abstract   = {The development of the intelligent transport space (ITS) comes with the challenge of securing transportation data. As the vehicular network is highly dynamic, the network architecture is susceptible to distributed malicious attacks irrespective of the emergence and integration of enabling technologies. A Software Defined Network (SDN) based VANET is an improvement over the traditional VANET and may be susceptible to attacks as a result of its centralized structure, resulting in dangerous circumstances. SDN-based VANET security for 5G deployments is essential and calls for integrating artificial intelligence tools for threat detection. An intrusion detection system was suggested in this work to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in the vehicular space. The proposed solution uses the Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) exhaustive parameter search technique and the Radial Basis Function Kernel of the Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) algorithm. The performance of other ML algorithms implemented was compared using key performance metrics. Experimental simulations to validate the proposed framework’s efficacy against DDoS intrusion show that the proposed scheme demonstrated an overall accuracy of 99.40% and a mean absolute error of 0.006.},

  abstract   = {The aim of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is to provide drivers and passengers with various applications and services for comfortable transportation by supporting traffic efficiency and safety. However, the traditional VANETs face various technical challenges in meeting the basic requirements of intelligent transportation systems such as scalability, flexibility and management due to the ever-increasing number of intelligent vehicles. With its flexible, programmable, scalable network structure, Software Defined Networks (SDNs) are candidates for providing solutions to the problems experienced. The architecture, which was created by adapting the SDN paradigm to the traditional VANET is simply called SD-VANET. This new architecture allows easy scaling of the network and flexible network management. Despite the advantages of SD-VANET architecture, it is also vulnerable to cyberattack threats such as Distributed Denial Of Service (DDoS). In this study, different machine learning classifiers were used to detect DDoS attacks targeting SD-VANETs. First, a dataset containing features of normal network traffic and DDoS attack network traffic was obtained from an experimentally created SD-VANET topology. Then the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) feature selection algorithm was used to select the most distinctive features of the dataset. Machine learning classifiers were trained and tested with both original and feature selection applied datasets. Moreover, in the learning phase, hyperparameter optimization for the classifiers was applied using the Bayesian optimization method. According to the experimental results, the highest accuracy score obtained was 99.35% with MRMR feature selection and Bayesian optimization-based decision tree classifier. The results demonstrate that the MRMR feature selection and Bayesian optimization-based classifier approach have been successful for the detection of DDoS attacks on SD-VANETs.},
