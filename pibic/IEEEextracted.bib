In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for monitoring network traffic and detecting abnormal activities. This IDS framework integrates streaming engines for big data analytics, management and visualization. A Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) topology of multiple connected nodes with mobility capability is simulated in the Mininet-Wifi environment. Real-time data is collected using the sFlow technology and transmitted from the simulator to our proposed IDS framework. We have achieved high detection accuracy results by training the Random Forest as the classifier to label out the anomalous flows. Additionally, the network throughput has been evaluated and compared with and without deploying the proposed IDS. The results verify the system is a lightweight solution by bringing little burden to the network.},

  abstract   = {The dynamic nature of the vehicular space exposes it to distributed malicious attacks irrespective of the integration of enabling technologies. The software-defined network (SDN) represents one of these enabling technologies, providing an integrated improvement over the traditional vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET). Due to the centralized characteristics of SDN, they are vulnerable to attacks that may result in life-threatening situations. Securing SDN-based VANETs is vital and requires incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Hence, this work proposed an intrusion detection model (IDM) to identify Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in the vehicular space. The proposed solution employs the radial basis function (RBF) kernel of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and an exhaustive parameter search technique called grid search cross-validation (GSCV). In this framework, the proposed architecture can be deployed on the onboard units (OBUs) of each vehicle, which receive the vehicular data and run intrusion detection tasks to classify a message sequence as a DDoS attack or benign. The performance of the proposed algorithm compared to other ML algorithms using key performance metrics. The proposed framework is validated through experimental simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting DDoS intrusion. Using the GridSearchCV, optimal values of the RBF-SVM kernel parameters “C” and “gamma”  $(\gamma)$  of 100 and 0.1, respectively, gave the optimal performance. The proposed scheme showed an overall accuracy of 99.33%, a detection rate of 99.22%, and an average squared error of 0.007, outperforming existing benchmarks.},

One of the most dangerous forms of attack that threaten vehicular communication systems are distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and increasing the security of VANETs against such attacks is a topic that a large number of researchers are now considering, were to provide highly effective security capabilities, machine learning (ML) techniques were applied. NSL-KDD or KDD-CUP99 datasets form the basis for the greater part of the current research. Attacks on these datasets were outdated. Therefore, we used a new dataset generated by OMNeT++, Veins, and Sumo. Two different types of attacks were conducted during this simulation, and the XGBoost classifier was used to evaluate and predict MDS systems.

  abstract   = {Security assurance in Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) is a crucial and challenging task due to the open-access medium. One great threat to VANETs is Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack because the target of this attack is to prevent authorized nodes from accessing the services. To provide high availability of VANETs, a scalable, reliable and robust network intrusion detection system should be developed to efficiently mitigate DDoS. However, big data from VANETs poses serious challenges to DDoS attack detection since the detection system require scalable methods to capture, store and process the big data. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a distributed DDoS network intrusion detection system based on big data technology. The proposed detection system consists of two main components: real-time network traffic collection module and network traffic detection module. To build our proposed system, we use Spark to speed up data processing and use HDFS to store massive suspicious attacks. In the network collection module, micro-batch data processing model is used to improve the real-time performance of traffic feature collection. In the traffic detection module, the classification algorithm based on Random Forest (RF) is adopted. In order to evaluate the accuracy of detection, the algorithm was evaluated and compared in the datasets, containing NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. The experimental results show that the proposed detection algorithm reached the accuracy rate of 99.95% and 98.75%, and the false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.05% and 1.08%, respectively, in two datasets.},

Existing DDoS detection systems in vehicular networks use a variety of Machine Learning (ML) methods. These techniques claim to be relevant and successful in attack detection in vehicular networks. The ML-based solutions use DDoS dynamics like adaptive traffic, heterogeneity, and packet features etc. As a result, a question arises whether these ML-based techniques are capable of handling novel security threats. In this paper, we use BayesNet technique on different datasets to test its performance and analyse the results to validate its usage for protecting against novel network security threats. BayesNet helps in decision making by improving data management and analysis. We use two datasets: simulation-based dataset and CIC-DDoS-2019 dataset. The CIC-DDoS-2019 dataset has 12 subsets and we use SYN, UDPLag and Portmap data subset. These datasets contain three types of DDoS attacks, i.e., SYN-flood attack, UDPLag attack, and Portmap attack. We test BayesNet to see the performance of the algorithm in detecting the mentioned forms of DDoS. We consider the parameters of accuracy, True Positive Rate (TPR), and False Positive Rate (FPR) for performance evaluation. In all the results, we observe that accuracy is always higher than 90%. TPR is very high, i.e. weighted TPR is 0.99 and wighted FPR of all tests is 0.076 that is quiet low. All these results prove that BayesNet ML technique is capable of detecting DDoS attack forms significantly.},

These detection & prevention techniques are implemented in different environments including vehicular network environments and computer network environments. Three different datasets connected to heterogeneous environments are adopted for experimentation. The first dataset is the NSL-KDD dataset based on the traffic of the computer network. The second dataset is based on a simulation-based vehicular environment, and the third CIC-DDoS 2019 dataset is a computer network-based dataset. These datasets contain different number of attributes and instances of network traffic. For the purpose of attack detection AdaBoostM1 classification algorithm is used in WEKA and for attack prevention Logit Model is used in STATA. Results show that an accuracy of more than 99.9% is obtained from the simulation-based vehicular dataset. This is the highest accuracy rate among the three datasets and it is obtained within a very short period of time i.e., 0.5 seconds.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most popular attack types aiming at the availability of system. We consider the timely detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks to RSU in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). A novel framework for detecting and mitigating low-rate DDoS attacks in ITS based on nonparametric statistical anomaly detection is proposed. Dealing with low-rate DDoS attacks is challenging since they can bypass traditional data filtering techniques while threatening the RSU availability due to their highly distributed nature. Extensive simulation results are presented for a real road scenario with the help of the SUMO traffic simulation software. The results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms two parametric methods for timely detection based on the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) test, as well as the traditional data filtering approach in terms of average detection delay and false alarm rate.},

Vehicular communication systems face significant risks from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. During a DDoS attack, multiple nodes are used to flood the target with an overwhelming amount of communication packets. In this paper, we first survey the current MDS literature and how it is used to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. We then propose a new distributed multilayer perceptron classifier (MLPC) for DDoS detection and evaluate the performance of the proposed detection scheme in vehicular communication systems. For the evaluations using simulations, two specific implementations of the attacks are conducted. Apache Spark is then used to create the distributed MLPC. The median F1-score for this MLPC method was 95%. The proposed method outperformed linear regression and support vector machines, which achieved 89% and 88% respectively, but is unable to perform better than random forests and gradient boosted trees which both achieved a 97% F1-score.

The suggested NIDS is built on a distributed random forest that can analyze huge amounts of data quickly. The two steps of the suggested method are the traffic gathering module and the attack detection module. In VANETs, the random forest method was employed for real-time DDoS attack detection. A variety of performance criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, were tested on the system to confirm the performance of the suggested framework. The proposed method achieves improved classification accuracy, according to the results. The suggested approach is suitable for complicated systems with high speed and low false alarm rates that require real-time intrusion detection.},
